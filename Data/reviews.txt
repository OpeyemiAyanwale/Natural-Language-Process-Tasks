its good
"I don't like it. so, i'm not recommend it.  i'm not say its a bad game.  its okay. so, since its free, go try yourself."
"It's a free to play game. Don't expect hundred of hours of gameplay. I will say though there are plenty of deck building strategies this game has to offer, some better than others, regardless they are all fun to use. The game isn't particularly difficult so I would consider this game to be fairly casual."
I'm unable to see this item in the customization screen.  Is there a fix for this?
"His damage is pretty low (only about 5 hits max) and his plus ultra is really weak, he's a good character to use in training though since it helps you learn the attacks better but he's a bad character to use in online battles or general battles"
 Very simplistic logical escape room game with simple yet effective visuals. It is definitelly cimbing game which could have benefit from more haptic feedback however can be real fun to beat. Got it on sale and am satified with it so far.
"I got some decent game play out of it for $3.   It's early access so I'm reviewing keeping that in mind. It's basic, but relaxing.  Some things I'd like to see added: A clear way to rotate a book into a ""proper"" upright position. More information on what items should be thrown away. Maybe a checklist. Having to sweep up or wipe things down could be fun.  For early access and room for improvement, I'd give it a 7/10"
brought the DLC and installed the DLC loaded the game up and still no DLC added no new cars or new workshop added wasted money. any help on locateing or even a better explanation on where this new ammo workshop is would be better when buying the DLC.
Game of the year 2023. Graphics: 10/10 Gameplay loop: 10/10 price: dirt cheap
"TimeTraveler is yet another of literally thousands of 2D retro platformers infesting Steam and lowering the average quality of all video games everywhere.  The only real plus here is that they eschew the amateur developer standard of crappy pixel ""art"" for some average hand drawn colour pencil art.  I guess that's an improvement, but the problem with indie/amateur 2D retro pixel platformers is not just the crap graphics, it's the old, dead, obsolete platformer gameplay.   This is a very low quality (so very standard) indie platformer, it's clunky and unpolished.  The ""time traveler"" gimmick is that you can progress through the level, stop, then revert to the start of the level...but this leaves a ""ghost"" of your previous level attempt, which you can use as a stepping platform to solve various puzzle platformer problems.  This gimmick has been done before, by better games, and adds little of value to this lacklustre experience.  There's no options to change the resolution for the game or customise the graphics settings.  There's no way for gamers to ensure this is running at the native resolution of their displays... there's no guarantee this game will look right on any PC as a result of this hamfisted design decision.  There's no way for gamers to try improve the low quality graphics.   The controls can't be customised, which will be an annoyance for many, but it can also render the game unplayable for differently-abled gamers.    The poor quality of this game is reflected by how many people spent time with it.  At the time of this review, SteamDB shows the all-time peak player number was only 2 players.  This is a remarkably low number, and now, the only player activity occurs once or twice a month, presumably someone loading it up to see what it is then quickly uninstalling it.  Considering there's over 120 million gamers on Steam and well over 50,000 games for gamers to choose from (over 9,000 completely free titles), the overwhelming lack of interest in this low quality game is to be expected.  TimeTraveler is relatively cheap at $1 USD, but it's not worth it. Given the defects and quality issues with the game, coupled with the unrealistic price, this is impossible to recommend.  [b][quote][url=https://partner.steamgames.com/doc/marketing/profile]Profile Features Limited![/url][/quote][/b]Valve have marked this game as ""Profile Features Limited"" at the time of this review.  This is usually caused by poor sales figures and low community acceptance for the game (to date).  Until this status changes, this game will not give you +1 to your Game Collector badge count, appear in profile achievements or any other Steam meta-accomplishments, nor can it be displayed in some profile showcases.  If these factors are important to you, it may be worth holding off before buying this game. "
"Game Length:  3hours+  3.5/5 Story: Super Simple  3/5 Gameplay: Super Simple and Grindy  3/5 Art: Not Bad.  Patch required.  4/5 Grand Total: Fair to below Fair compared to most other rpgmakers.  6.75/10  Honest opinion time! Game scores pretty low sadly. Game has 2 endings, MSQ true ending is only 3hours worth of content including grinding.  Im assuming the other ending is the bad ending so the game is very simple, just choose to do MSQ or the bad stuff.  Story and content was very thin, just bare minimal.  1 Side quest.  Events/Scenes only happen during Boss Rooms and the Aftermath of it.  The Bad Ending content unknown as I usually pursue it 2ndary.  Gameplay was very Simple and Grindy.  Retro buy spells to learn rather than learning through leveling up based on your class modern games.  Not only that if you dont have the spells required to beat certain enemies/dungeons your gonna be grinding until you figure out what you need.  Retro and Simple because you just choose your BIS.  Spam your best to win.  Only 1 partymember which is the MC and that restricts the games potential.  Art was nice.  Not the worst or best, i liked it but not my favorite but still recommendable.  The devs definitely put a lot of effort into the Map Layouts and the Assets and Particles.  Very adventurous but somewhat empty because theres no npcs in the dungeons or any events that can occur.  Very point A to point B.  To sum it up the game is fair at most only.  Wasn't super fun or anything it was alrite.  I support this genre and I would love to see further potential achieved.  I can barely recommend this, I would fear the players wouldn't enjoy it too much as it was ok for me only.  If you would like to pick up your copy of H and put it on your indies H-Shelf you can do a sale because if you play it now or later, you're definitely not missing out"
i love it. very good 8/10
"Its a decent game, tried the demo and was fun. Seemed to be easier and faster to advance and get coins than the original game. Alot more forgiving and every coin wasn't needed for survival. They seem to be improving quite well."
"Yeah, both the main menu ""official guide"" button and the guide button under the ""Help and Guide"" tab do nothing. You have to go into your steamapps-->common-->City of Broken Dreamers Book One-->game-->cobd-guide(PDF file) in order to view the guide.  Edit: Day after I posted this review both links immediately pull up the guide in-game."
"[h1]At a Glance[/h1] [table]     [tr]         [td](Adult) Content[/td]         [td]No.[/td]     [/tr]     [tr]         [td]Censorship[/td]         [td]Not applicable.[/td]     [/tr]     [tr]         [td]Hours of Gameplay[/td]         [td]Thirty minutes.[/td]     [/tr]     [tr]         [td]Modding Support?[/td]         [td]No.[/td]     [/tr]     [tr]         [td]Patch Available?[/td]         [td]To my knowledge, no.[/td]     [/tr] [/table]  [b]Maidesktop[/b] is a mildy lewd desktop pet featuring a maid and BDSM equipment.  [h1]Gameplay[/h1] After booting up [b]Maidesktop[/b], a reasonably attractive woman will appear on-screen. For the sake of simplicity, I'll refer to her as ""Cute Maid"", taking inspiration from the ""About the Game"" section on the Steam store page. Cute Maid lives on your screen, and she is overlayed over your applications. You can touch and whip her body, but her reactions are short-lived and [i]frankly[/i] not very entertaining.  Like [b]Summer Girl[/b], [b]Maidesktop[/b] features unlockable content.  New hair, outfits and poses can be unlocked by moving the mouse cursor. [b]Summer Girl[/b] required roughly an hour of violently jerking the mouse cursor back and forth to unlock all content. I think that the movement required for [b]Maidesktop[/b] is more reasonable for content to be unlocked naturally, such as browsing the internet or perhaps solving puzzle games. If you're impatient, you can unlock everything Cute Maid has to offer you in under twenty minutes.  To read the full length ""Gameplay"", be sure to check this review out on Wombat Trap (dot-com).  [h1]Story[/h1] There is no story, moving on.  [h1]Visuals[/h1] I'll be copy/pasting some content from my review for [b]Summer Girl[/b], a similar piece of software with a nearly identical interface.  There is no title menu. Language preference can be adjusted by a small button that appears when your cursor hovers over her legs. It's tedious to navigate to your choice language, as each option must be clicked through one-by-one. You may alter the appearance of the avatar through an always-active menu, but it suffers the same flaw as the language button. The interface (to my knowledge) cannot be hidden, and as a result detracts from the in-game experience.  To read the full length ""Visuals"", be sure to check this review out on Wombat Trap (dot-com).  [b] - The Goods -[/b] Cute Maid can be touched and whipped, but her reactions aren't very arousing. She fails as an arousing character, and given what she can do I don't think she's exactly ""family friendly"" either. In my opinion, adult-software is all or nothing; if you're not aiming for a full adult experience, you should instead aim your game for everyone else. Expect not-quite female nudity.  [h1]Verdict[/h1] I don't recommend this game, but I almost do. I think this is a great foundation for a cool desktop pet, and with some added liveliness and an improved menu it'd be an okay piece of software. If the concept of a highly-customizable, super interactive desktop buddy was realized in the future, I would be willing to pay a premium for a sort of ""[b]Maidesktop MK II[/b]"". Until then, I'd sit on an update or two before purchasing this software on sale.

it does not work at all is don't think its a good game anyways i don't recommend this game
Game is fine/..:)
"Nice challenging route. Great rolling stock. The sounds as usual are recycled with the exception of the horns, which in my opinion are not that bad. Great scenery. Nice little scenic route. The route grades fluctuate quite a bit providing a good challenge"
Game will not load no matter which Access database you install.
"Charming, fun, little party game with some interesting mechanics"
"This hairstyle is just awesome and one of the best so far ♡ You can also change the color and if you want to know what it looks like, click [url=https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2828317661]here[/url]"
Pretty chillaxing fun game but don't expect any checkpoints or saves!
This game has nice graphics and is pretty realistic. You'll find yourself losing your balance a lot on big jumps and spins. There is also stuff you can unlock by getting medals from winning which is a cool touch. Overall fun game!
"I'm an avid baseball fan and search far and wide for a VR baseball game that's more than just Homerun Derby.  "" Inside the Park"" is the best baseball training sim I've played. The game currently has hitting and fielding and the developer is adding pitching as well as other content. The developer also listens to feedback to further improve the experience so if you're a baseball fan I highly recommend this training simulator"
"It's like all of my favorite games mashed into one!  Sweet track building, crazy truck building, explosive turrets, gun action, and so much more to come I've heard!   Can't wait for the multiplayer to go live!"
The second DLC for Erannorth is another welcome addition to the game. It adds quite a few new cards and lots of new enemies to increase the games replayability further. The price is reasonable. If you like the base game and would like to see a bit more variantion - get this DLC.
Worth the money.
Has pretty much everything you need in a hockey management sim. Tons of stats and info on players and staff to help you decide how to shape your team. Good customization options for making your own league. But match sims are really boring and you have no coaching options to affect anything during the match. They don't have the jerseys for teams outside the NHL but there's a good mod in the workshop to fix most of them. It's a good game but I'd wait for a sale if you can.
"Tried it out, quickly got bored/grew tired of it.  You stand in a room in VR. Exciting, right? It gets better!  You hold in trigger to make the butter jump, and you use your touchpad/joystick to aim it. And then if you want to get CRAZY, you can tilt the controller upwards to jump a bit differently (note: only works 50% of the time?)  Sounds crazy exciting fun right?! RIGHT?!  Yeah I got bored fast. I made it past an obstacle, lost on the next, then got sent back. It's obnoxious more than anything, don't bother, it's just a weird free game with so little effort I have to wonder if there's anything shady going on under the hood...."
Boring
"A lot of tracks and plane is very fast. If you are racer for some time and you race with skill, this game can be something rare the man can play."
"Basic tips for devs!!!  - I know that the game could become F2P, but best practice is to give in that situation something extra to the players that bought the game!  - I know that mechanics could change in fixes, but not the core one (as strategic concept in this situation), because peoples bought the game largely just because of these core mechanics. If someone is not so sure about the basics of their own game, he should first work out the details (before the game is released or at least by doing it in early access)!!  - If you wanted to make F2P historical visual novel under the auspices of IPN (Polish Institute of National Remembrance), it should be a separate title on the same engine and resorces. it's so simple!!!  One thing I'm happy with is that I made a backup before the update, and I can still play the previous strategy version in Steam offline mode...  EDIT: After today's announcement (08/24/2023), posted by devs a minutes ago, I see that second and third tip was partly used by introducting ""Legacy Version"" which could be downloaded by switching versions in game properties betas branch (not intuitive at all)...   ...but still I didn't know if I switch between the new, basic version of the game, and the Legacy Version, will the saves from both be saved properly locally and in the cloud, and they'll not break nor do they overwrite each other, when switching between versions, so that I can go back to both of these versions saves at any time? I doubt.. :-\  A better solution would be to separate these titles as I wrote earlier, or choose the type of gameplay in the main menu of the game (even if the new, more linear one, would be the one promoted in the menu by default).  After the above mentioned announcement, I also have a fourth basic piece of advice for the devs:  - COMMUNICATION !!!  If it had been written in the message announcing the upcoming new version that you have problems with doing everything at once, and that the separation of the versions will take place soon, you would avoid a large part of negative comments. You might also hear and take advice from people who liked the earlier version of the game (even with its flaws) and who bought it supporting you, that maybe it's better not to complicate version switching to the point of requiring to redownload it every time, and just separate the titles, or leave the old one e.g. in the form of DLC, so that you can choose the type of gameplay in the game main menu, and thanks to this saves from both types of gameplay could coexist.  PS. I still haven't heard anything in terms of replies to my first basic tip :("
"This game is one of the best retro Pokemon style games I have played. It has very responsive controls and what seems to be a really good risk/reward mechanic. It's very charming and is just the right amount of challenge where it isn't overwhelming but is still a fun and varietal time. Oh, and slug."
"It's quite an engaging story, but i am mostly fan of the pixelart."
Family fun for the whole adventure family
"I know, very few time playing but this should be anough for first impressions:  Spells are ineffective to damage anything:  Magic system is very underdeveloped, if you like to cast magic... This might be a bad idea: - Bad for solo play. - You have no options to block enemy attacks. - Low damage. - Reagents for everything,  - Once you cast, you have to get a weapon out (like a sword) what's the point of magic?   Parry is bad: Once you decide to parry, you can't switch the direction you are defending, you have to wait for the animation to get bad and then raise it again, good luck with mouse parry (is terrible)  Indoor illumination is very strange: Some homes with torches are never ""on"" unless you are close enough.  Once you get into a cave, all illumination get reduced by about 50% and the deeper you go, the darker it get, even with the torches around (iI'd believe that you get used to darknes and eventually you are able to see more but no, it never happen)  For some odd reason, dungeons are almost pitch black, you need to have a torch out, you can use a weapon and a torch for dungeons (you are most likely to need a group, one must have the torch) having the torch makes you the main target.  Enemies have no issues to see in dark (why? They are not even monsters)  Will be just me ranting about this for sure.  Graphics are good, I like them, the game probably needs some more refining. "
"I bought it on sale, so that's a plus... Is it worth the sale price? Debatable. Worth full price? Definitely not. There is just not enough to it. The art style is really cute, but that's where it ends for me. Every level is the same thing over and over. You click the yarn ball (or whatever) a cat runs to it, you click something else, you move forward, etc. etc. etc. until you run through the door. Cute idea, but needs something more. I finished it only for the sake of finishing."
"Very lewd stuff here but it never goes full blown adults only nsfw, or at least as far as i could tell, it wants you to replay the game over and over again picking a different girl on the island to stick to each time to unlock every ending and achievement one by one, i only did it 4 times and got four achievements from 4 different ones, and only one was super lewd borderline adults only and it even involved the cliche tentacle monster hentai trope. Good stuff here, but it gets really repetitive. Maybe one day i will come back to this game and get the rest of the endings from the other four girls i never picked. Also the game is free and worth checking out i guess. lol"
"If you're looking for a fun game to play with your friends that you don't have to take too seriously. Look no further!  As the description tells you, this is an early access CCC game. A game where you and your friends can have a lot of fun trying to pilot a ship on land, ram each other with a car and have fun with the ragdoll animations of your opponents. But you can also progress through the story, fight bosses and collect loot and rare items. You also have the opportunity to explore a lot, especially in the first world.   You will encounter glitches and bugs, but they are part of the fun.  I strongly recommend playing the game in multiplayer and not solo. The enemies don't scale accordingly and you will have an easier time if you play with someone else.   Finally, I would like to give one piece of advice: Being sober while playing is completely optional!"
"That is what really can be called a wargame. No camps/bases, no resources or making new troops, no faster-click-to-win. Small map, some time, terrain, maneuvers and your commander mind. Very refreshing after fantasy/sci-fi games where you need just rush the enemy. There you must be realistic and pragmatic, not dramatically heroic. Take with -75%. For $1 that's a perfect game!"
An absolute gem of a game! A great platformer and something I never knew I needed in my life. Even the final boss was a total hottie lmao.   Thank you for such a great game! I look forward to discovering more from you guys.
"Much like the Apollo 11 stuff, I've played so many of these VR Surgery demos as to completely lose track of which one is which. I certainly have an increased appreciation for medical equipment that's for sure. This one at least looks from my video to be of decent quality, but the rub is always in the interactions. Some have horrible input. These apps, while they usually have only one 'level' and aren't really advanced kinds of treatments, like brain surgery, still demystify the profession somewhat. [spoiler]I feel like I could operate on any of you.[/spoiler]"
"Its like somebody took Death Note and Code Geass and pumped out a visual novel. I could see an actual anime being made out of this, which makes sense, because I believe an anime is what the developer was really trying to make. And many anime have their roots in visual novels. Not bad at all."
Very cool to see the planet come to life.

I can only echo his sentiment, and [b]amazing pyramids: rebirth[/b] is definitely a good choice to word with. can't make any comparisons to the original, which seems to be a [i]big fish[/i]-exclusive and I'd never heard of it before running into this.  [u]adventure mode[/u] is the main event. not much of a story, [b]55 levels[/b], plus 7 optional jigsaws on the side every now and then. they don't even replace word game levels, just add some variety if you want (I didn't).  most levels are pyramids, the game randomly picks one of the [b]120+ word categories[/b], and you have to figure out what's the 9-letter word at the bottom, then the 8-letter one in another category, and so on, the last being a 3-letter word. no descriptions, no freestyling any old 9-letter fruit or whatever, just click on letters from the alphabet and see if they're there. [b]it's basically hangman[/b] is what I'm saying, and [b]words don't repeat until you run out[/b].  combos are a thing if you guess multiple letters in a row correctly, making no mistakes and finishing a word quickly are also rewarded, and a bit of extra cash is paid for any remaining letters after each word. unfortunately, [b]money is just the local equivalent of points[/b] and can't be used for anything.  [b]vital energy[/b] is an actual resource, though not one with much use. it drains a bit after every selected letter, whether it's correct or not, and if there's some left at the end of an in-game day (i.e.: at the end of a level), bully for you. and more meaningless points.  [b]the stone of afterlight[/b] is a nifty thing, can be used as often as you like and at any point in the guessing process to enter the full word without using energy. you can change your mind, but if you're right, you'll get a random bonus. if you're wrong, the current word will re-roll with a new category and you lose some points.  while money has no use, there are still [b]power-ups[/b] that come in 4 flavors to reveal letters in a specific spot or all the vowels, or mark a few incorrect letters or replace the current category and word. they're collected by using the stone of afterlight and by solving words quickly and efficiently.  [b]adventure levels can't be replayed individually[/b], which is a bit weird, except there's no resources to farm, you'll be swimming in power-ups soon enough, and why replay a specific level when they're all the same? well, almost, as themed levels have the same category for every word, while in others everything starts with the same letter. [b]end-of-level animations can be skipped[/b], always appreciated, you can even click while a category is being chosen to make it quicker, and [b]mid-level progress is saved when you quit[/b]. sadly, scoring animations and some others are unskippable and pretty slow.  [u]manuscript mode[/u] unlocks by reaching level 7, the first manuscript in adventure mode. it's a timed game, have to [b]recreate as many words from jumbled letters as you can in 3 minutes[/b]. you'll get a new set of letters after every word, and such levels during the adventure can be skipped. the biggest problem is, [b]only one preset solution is accepted[/b], so while [i]sure[/i] should be a perfectly cromulent word, only [i]user[/i] is accepted on that occasion. also, fancy [b]animations waste precious seconds[/b].  [u]shard mode[/u] unlocks by reaching level 13, the first shard in adventure mode. it's similar to manuscript, except here you have to [b]create as many words as you can in 3 minutes, using the same set of letters[/b]. adventure levels like this can also be skipped.  [u]blitz mode[/u] unlocks after completing adventure mode. it's about decrypting a full pyramid without clues or power-ups, and there's a 100-turn limit provided by the vital energy meter. the stone of afterlight is still at your service.  evidently, there's [b]plenty of content and variety[/b] on offer, and it's presented with the usual casual game aesthetics. 4 dictionaries [b](english, german, french and russian)[/b], separate volume settings and toggles to get rid of annoying interjections while playing a level (cutscenes aren't voiced), and a [b]useless windowed mode[/b] (non-resizable window without resolution options). online leaderboards for every game mode and in-game representation of achievements are also available.  [b]keyboard support would be great[/b], typing instead of clicking, and ideally it'd extend to other areas of the ui, so it could be played completely mouse-free. toggles for certain animations would be welcome as well.  other than these, it's an [b]excellent word game[/b]. cool concept, looks and sounds good enough, can be as easy or difficult as you want it to be, and the price is reasonable as well."
"Well, i miss the demo"
"Knights of the Tiny Table is a well-made, simple puzzle game with a relaxing aesthetic. The majority of the gameplay centers around rolling 4 dice, which you then use to open a row or column on a grid to place a hero. These heroes have predefined attack patterns, so your dice rolls and hero placements become the essential cornerstones of each turn.  As others have mentioned, it's a bit light on content - it takes a fair amount of grinding to acquire new heroes, and there's no alternate objective aside from doing so. Some additional quests or objectives would go a long way.  Aside from this, there are a few quality of life improvements that would be fairly easy to implement and would really reduce tedium: 1. If you roll two of the same number, automatically place both dice on the grid 2. Make left-click place a dice on its row, right-click place a dice on its column 3. Don't require a mouse drag - single left-click to select a hero, another left-click to place hero  Additionally, a few other changes would increase player motivation and replay value: 1. Display what new heroes do before you buy them 2. Look into reducing cost of new heroes - as-is, it takes ~30 minutes to acquire each hero, which seems like a pretty steep curve 3. Overhaul the music - the current track becomes grating quickly - a medieval-themed ambient track would be a huge improvement 4. Add in a harder difficulty with a few key changes: no moving of dice or heroes once placed and a timer/time attack element  Overall, a great effort and well-worth a couple bucks.

"What a fantastic demo! I don't usually play text parser games and wasn't sure I'd engage in the same way I might with point & clicks, I was completely wrong. Found myself grabbing a notepad, coming up with ideas, consulting the archive- I really felt like I was working out the mystery.  It pulls you into the story so well, and the characterisations are vividly written through the dialogue. The way the story develops through your own research is really clever, and it also has a nice understated British tone to it.  Thoroughly enjoyed this, sad to reach the end so it's on my wishlist now."
damn deffinetly worth it best 22 minutes of my life i dont even know if i can handle 1 more minute of it
"There are a lot of UI annoyances, but the game consistently published a large number of weekly puzzles for free, so it's still worth playing through IMHO.  Note that this game is NOT just advertisement for more levels. Every week, they release a new set of free puzzles, so you can play unlimited puzzles if you just wait a week. And there's so many puzzles released (Approximately 200 new puzzles released every week) that you probably won't even have to wait -- you'll get new puzzles before you finish going through the ones you already have. You can literally keep playing this game for hours and hours without paying a single cent.  Some of the UI annoyances I've experienced:  * The difficulty ratings are wonky; there are some 4 star difficulty puzzles that are easier than the 1 star ones. * There's a lot of temporary markings that I'd like to make, but the game does not support. Some of the marks are inconsistent between puzzles, like some ""trace the path"" type puzzles let you mark a barrier between cells, and some don't, even though knowing that the path does not pass through a given pair of cells is useful in both puzzles. ** For example, in Island Country, it'd be nice if we could mark numbers to say how many black cells we expect to exist in a region. ** In One Liar, it'd be nice if we could mark which numbers we thought were real and which ones we thought were liars. * The ""Check"" button is only useful when you've completed a puzzle. It would be nice if you accidentally used the same number twice in a region, for example, it could find and point out the mistake for you. But instead, if you have any empty cells, it'll just say you have empty cells. * There's no convenient way to ""just show me all the puzzles I haven't solved yet"". You have to pick a puzzle category (e.g. ""path drawing""), then a puzzle type (e.g. koburin), to see the list of koburin puzzles of a specific size (e.g. 8x8), and check if you've completed them all. If not, you then might have to check the other sizes (e.g. 10x10). After checking all the sizes, you have to back out to koburin to be back in the list of path drawing, and then check the next puzzle type. I'd be way more convenient to have a screen that shows all unsolved puzzles, regardless of type or size."
"Great start to an Early access game. Tons of potential and the Dev seems excited and committed on growing the game and making it better. I have played several EA games that have fallen short of my expectations, but this game has enough content in-game to make it worth the price. As with all EA games, there is some tuning to be done, and some small bugs to work out, but i haven't run into any significant issues as of yet. If you are a fan of disk golf, you will have a good time with this one."
Good puzzle game and good graphics
"Cool little experience, I think I need to familiarise myself with the source material first and then give this another try. It only takes about 20 minutes to get through it. The reviews are a bit misleading since very little of this game is interactive and there isn't really any exploration, but having ""played"" through it once it's clear this was an intentional choice."
better than VRC+
"great little TD game, worth it"
"Really enjoyable I've had a hard time finding a Mystery Dungeon that doesn't have frustrating UI, Legion's Crawl is smooth and fast to play.  I wish it had more shortcut keys so it could be played entirely with keyboard"
Everyone says 'E' but I say 'A'. Only real ones understand
Basically this class is trash for both PVP and PVE. We should be payed to use this garbage. God damn it. I wish I was dead every time I remember I bought this shit.
"I knew what was going on when I saw the dev's name...  No disrespect, but this game is a MESS... Why not put a bit more time in it? In the current state I would not even dare to release and charge money for it. The controls are awful, there are no settings. And the maps look like they were put together in a few hours at most.  I like marble games, but there are some better ones on steam for the same price or less.  So, it is going to be a not recommended."
"Very artsy casual indie game. Extremely short and tbh. not worth the 2,99€ for the existing content. Worth getting it when its on sale though, exploring every nook and cranny was quite enjoyable"
"Interesting concept, very cute and unique looking. Reminds me of a much more calm and relaxing version of Minit"
"An excellent challenge for those who like history. With simple mechanics but an innovative game concept, this game really impressed me. I recommend!"
"I've played a lot of Tower Defense games and this looks like a TD with a lot of depth. I've only played the first stage and after a few tries I managed to create a custom loadout and survived over 100 waves. By getting the right combination you can get stun towers, armor piercing towers, etc. I'm really impressed! I still have a lot to explore and experiment. A tip for the developer: Currently the effect of RNG seems to be very popular among players like me who also like TDs. Example is AutoChess and now there's a very nice new game mode in Warcraft 3 called Random Ability Tank Defense. I believe you can get a lot of inspiration from that game in case you'd like to add future updates. My suggestion is maybe add a mode where you are dealt with different random scenarios, like random towers or enemies. Also, I'm not sure if it's possible to upgrade towers individually. For example upgrade a Tower from level 1 to level 2. I really like that in TDs, as you get to prioritize which towers specifically you'd like to buff. I know there are global upgrades like damage %, but not sure if there are individual tower upgrades. Thank you for this AMAZEng game!  "
"Pretty fun for $4! Very janky but it's almost fun for that. If you find its way too hard; purchase the hearts at the inn for a level up. (Iirc, the game doesn't tell you what they do. So I figured it out on my own after suffering through 1-2 at level 1)"
"Absolutely loved this game!  A tearjerker-horror story.  Beautiful music, art, and story.  The search mechanic is pretty scary and the Automaton is a really nice touch.  10 of 10."
"[h1]Before I played Omnify Hotspot, I had a small pp, no friends, no gf, depression, and no life. These things havent changed, but the game is pretty good[/h1]"
A nice Sokoban-like game with a decent number of levels and enough variety of features to keep things interesting.
"I bought this game in May 2019, and I've enjoyed watching it develop gradually over time. I think at this stage in early access, it has a lot of potential and it is definitely worth showing some early support. The devs are definitely putting in the work and I wish them the best of luck.  [b]Pros:[/b]  [list]     [*]Relaxing atmosphere. I like to come to this game to relax after playing any of the [spoiler]other fox-related games on Steam with depressing endings (a.k.a. every fox game I've played so far besides this one).[/spoiler] At this stage in the game's development, all you need to do is just explore and enjoy yourself.     [*]The world(s) look great. The devs utilized Unity pretty well to make a world that is both pleasing to the eye and engaging to explore.     [*]In the more complete sections (so far), the game runs smoothly. Animations run well and are generally believable.      [*]There are lots of interesting secrets to discover all around the map. I advise that you take your time, look, and listen closely.     [*]The game looks to have a bright future. The devs seem very dedicated to making it a fun experience and it is clear they have good ambitions for the game. There are frequent (every few days or so) small updates, so you know they are actively working on it. It sounds like the end product will be nice, although it's a bit of a mystery as to what they have in mind (but that's probably intentional). [/list]   [b]Cons:[/b] [list]     [*]Trees sort of sprout up on their own in the first world (the one you start in after beginning a new game). I'm not sure if this is intentional or not but it's kind of trippy.      [*]The world you enter via the den/cave (by the statue) in the first world has some extreme lag issues currently. When I enter it, the game lags every few seconds. My highish-spec custom PC was just built in February, so I don't think that's the issue.     [*]The camera feels a bit unusual. The way it responds to mouse movement is strange (move mouse up = move camera down) and the opposite of most other games. Checking the ""alternate y-axis"" box in settings (the only settings option at the moment) doesn't fix this. You can also see through the ground if you move it in certain ways.     [*]As another reviewer said, pressing ""F"" makes you die. I'm not really sure why that's there unless it's for the sake of the ""press F to pay respects"" meme.     [*]The music can get kind of monotonous after playing for a while (similar to how it does in The First Tree).     [*]Sometimes animal sounds carry forever. You might hear a cat meowing the entire game, but have no cats near you. [/list]  As you may notice, my cons list is basically just a bug report. I am confident that the issues will be addressed eventually. This is alpha-stage early access after all, and the description states that this game is being made by a team of two people. [b]Therefore, I am still happy to recommend the game.[/b] If you aren't convinced, definitely wishlist it, because this is one to watch.  P.S. I've played this game for longer than Steam says I have. I usually pin my games to the Start menu via .exe file and Steam doesn't count games started from there into playtime. I'd say I've played for about an hour total so far."

[h1]Gameplay[/h1] Manage your income and your lady-workforce in real time via some of the most [i]furious clicking[/i] I've ever done. If your money goes under negative one-hundred, it's game-over. Each month, you have to generate a minimum of 750 (plus 250 per lady) money to pay rent. In addition, each lady also has an [i]hourly rate,[/i] which increases as they become qualified for higher-paying jobs. Each job requires one or more prerequisites, such as special training or well being. As you gain more and more funding, you can employ more ladies and take advantage of pricier services. You can adjust the speed of the game to suit your clicking-speed — once I reached a party of seven, at five-times speed it was impossible for me to keep up with every one of my ladies.  [h1]Story[/h1] There is no story (and I’m not making one up).  [h1]Visuals[/h1] The titlescreen is too dark and the user-interface failed to impress. From ""Options"", you can adjust audio, difficulty and display preferences. You can review unlocked CGs from the ""Scrapbook"". The in-game visuals are all over the place. The world map is rendered with cartoony models, and the characters are rendered with more realistic models and textures. The characters are really hit or miss (and mostly miss). Each character appeared to be a different style, which was incredibly jarring. If the game only focused on Candy, the tutorial girl, the lewd content might have been worth something.  [b]- The Goods-[/b] There are a good selection of static (and a few animated)  CGs that are unlocked simply by playing the game. Each CG is tied to a lady and an action, such as a date or a job. Most of the CGs show the cast in non-lewd situations, though a few jobs (such as the ""Stripper"" job) may offer nudity. The models are. . . not that great. The animations are choppy, and the images are way too dark, and inconsistently rendered. I was not impressed by the gallery.  [h1]Verdict[/h1] I really can't recommend this game, but the price is about right. The gameplay is engaging, but it's not fun. You won't be spending much, if any of the game actually enjoying the lewd content. I spent my entire playthrough micro-managing a series of colored bars, and that pretty much sums up the whole game — watch bars go down and try to figure out (mostly in vain) how to play the game correctly. I had to learn what did what (and how much everything costs) through trial-and-error. For your efforts, the lewd content is hardly worth the stress.

"Lurkers Is a pretty cool little game. It definitely focuses more on the story than the romance, and the mystery is quite obvious. I knew who the villain was from the first conversation I had with him, and it wasn't because i'm good at solving mysteries lol. There were also some typos and grammatical issues, especially towards the end of the game. The game's greatest strengths are it's atmospheric soundtrack, and Jack the Ripper, of course. It helps that I find the Jack the Ripper case fascinating.  It was fun, and I enjoyed my time with it. 5/10"
Wholesome as heck
Great game :) a nice fun little fighter with cute pixel art
bruh romania horror game
"I am a Buddha, I first say the game as the name, self-going chess to increase the escape you can not operate the characters, the beginning of the selection of talent, resilience equals the blood, set the equipment to raise the star, kill the zombie king to get boff, he does not say The property that the equipment is acquired after the star, I just want to ask you that you have ak. Why don’t you shoot, do you have to go to the front? ? ?"
Not finsihed bots suck  I got bored multiplayer is nothing also if we can get a sandbox or first person  its not the best but i would say give it year of development and it might be better 
"Despite my character seemingly spending most of the game exhausted, tired, or generally defenseless, I liked it the first time around, only to hit a bad ending when I refused to give up something important. Still, since I was asked to create an ending save, I figured it would probably work out in the second game, only to load the save and instantly get a bad ending there, too. Therefore, I replayed the first game and was forced to go along with the intended route, and a railroaded choose-your-own-adventure story is never a good thing. It hides the fact that the choices don’t matter rather well, but it becomes undeniable when you’ve played through it multiple times like I have. As such, this game went from great to mediocre. [spoiler]The romances and the story are excellent, but I’d never willingly give up a part of myself, and being forced to as well as merge with someone if you want to play the second game didn’t sit right with me. I’d rather have found a large hammer and made myself some soul stone dust.[/spoiler] (5/10)"
"No cheap jumpscares, a genuine creepy and dark atmosphere, and the game is actually scary when you play it alone. I'd say this is horror done right."
"[h1]Before I played Living Dead, I had a small pp, no friends, no gf, depression, and no life. These things havent changed, but the game is pretty good[/h1]"
"yes! its great, realistic models. very slow and i like it"
"great game. fun game, get to slash down other players all over the world... come join the fight and lets concord the world..the fun part is trying to slay everyone and leveling up and  trying to be the master. graphics are well done and looks amazing. cant wait to see everyone in the fight."
A very good tower defense game. Good graphics. I would like to see a tutorial for getting started.
"I had very low expectations and they were met.  So much about this could have been better.  For now the only good VR ""movies"" are animated."
game is not developed well. filled with toxic players and power trip developers and league admins.  no updates or anything new to do with friends :(  tons of weirdos 0/10 i was bullied :(
"I love this version of the game very much. I like it a lot more than CoM for Windows, despite the fact that the second one has more spells, settings, and even fixed the appearance of the trees."
"Wow you made it all the way down here!  That means you are either one of two people: 1. You saw the screenshots and went ""Oh, this looks awful. Cant wait to see what the reviews say on that note!"" 2. You are like me (loves racing games) and through a series of random chance events found yourself on this games page. As is clear by this I am not going to be  trashing this game because I for one enjoyed it.   At this point there is something so exciting about finding a racing game Ive yet to hear of and for only 99 cents I couldnt resist.   The racing games of the nintendo 64 are some of the best ones out there in my opinion. It was a time when racing games where in vogue and developers were trying all sorts of different things. What this game manages to do is capture the inventive level design of those games while being soaked in what I can only describe as A E S T H E T I C. Thats not to say the design is incredibly complex. There are only three tracks and they all follow some basic theme but with very little in the way of landmarks and set pieces just a lot of strange ramps and bridges coating the low detailed world. Like I said though I like this. Turn off the sound effects and you find yourself in an almost dreamlike state speeding through landscapes that look like they come from some old graphics demo.   I dont really judge games based on any sort of objective quality (for the most part) so my views here are meant to convey to you the experience that I had and therefore I cant say this will map onto anyone else even fellow racing game fans.  Since this game is fairly small Ill add some things here I think could be added if dlc was ever to come: More tracks with similar qualities to those already here A more open level about driving around looking for things. This design could also being incorporated for a dk racing style hub as I think that the physics of the game fit this sort of design."
"Understand that, to start with, all I could find was 4 puzzles.  I finished these in 14 minutes.  Now, they are promising free DLC with lots of content, so there is that.  My only real problem here was the lack of controls.  There was a 15-20 second clip of how to ""swap"" pieces...easy enough, howerer, I had to control+tab to get out as there were no menus for this.  That should be fixed.  However, for the price I paid...it was worth the time/efforts."
Don't spend anything else on this game. Unless you're in love.
I'm part of the problem.  Not the solution.
"The concept of this game is interesting, however it's not working properly. It's not optimized and there're several bug that need to be fixed.  I have huge lags as soon as I approach 50/55 Days so I put almost everything in LOW, disable the shadows and fog and FPS are still bad (going up and down between 5 and 120 fps all everytime the sun rises, it's only ok when it's dark). Another problem also, as soon as 2 eggs die, the descendants start to be unmanageable (put fire everywhere, they never calm down, they just burn the village down until everything is destroyed, so.. you lost).    I've tried the classic mode and the build mode, and it's the same problem in each mode :  Low FPS, unmanageable eggs, end of the village, Defeat.   PS: I play on ultra/very high in all the games that I play (GTX ROG Strix 1600, 16Go Ram, Intel i7 7700K...)"
"I got hold of a beta test key. With this beta test key, I wasn't able to figure out how to rotate the camera which I really wanted. A controller works well, and there is no tutorial. I did find a fellow deer, but this deer was floating backwards. I believe the goal of the maps was to move towards a yellow mineral which moved me to a different map with other blips on the map. Walking through trees is possible, and I saw no collision detection. The deer I was controlling had very strange colours, and the deer had a slight animation problems when it was running up or down hills. I would have preferred a more natural looking deer. The most off putting thing is when walking up or down a hill and the immobile camera showed the underside of the hill. The sky coloured bottom below my deer and short line of land separating my deer from falling forever wasn't relaxing to see. My deer didn't fall through the land though, so big plus.  Since I have a beta test key, I'll assume the bugs I found are a result of that. If the bugs are fixed, this game might be fun for people who enjoy walking simulators."
"Skeleton Crew is a fun platform brawler that has fast combat, a variety of characters with different skill sets, an upgrade system, and a shop. You and your friends can go out and complete levels and gain better upgrades and equipment.  The dialog and story are fun and slightly salty. For $15 this one is priced just right. Prepare to be entertain and leave with a smile.  Quick look video: https://youtu.be/FrXLnunTCMQ  [table]  [tr] [th]If you enjoyed my review join our steam group.

seriously overpriced
Would not recommend any of the songs in this music pack. Found them boring to play and too easy compared to other levels in the game
"Olá, já pude testar esta DLC junto com as melhorias da Update 27, e está sensacional, novas prefabs, novos modelos de placas, tipos de rodovias, cidades inteiramente novas, e não apenas um ctrl+c, ctrl+v.  Agora temos as pontes que se movimentam para deixar passar as embarcações e com isso param o trânsito, e vários marcos das belas cidades Holandesas. Esta DLC, na minha opinião é prova que a TML continua à desenvolver os seus jogos continuamente, assim com a SCS faz com os seus jogos. Dou nota 10 para esta DLC, ainda mais pelo preço que veio para o Brasil, prova que a empresa faz a chamada converção social do Dólar para o nosso Real. Parabéns pelo belo trabalho TML. À seguir da minha análise em inglês, deixo minha playlist, onde exploro as cidades da Holanda e um pouco de sua vegetação/estradas.  Hi, I was able to test this DLC along with the improvements of Update 27, and it is sensational, new prefabs, new license plate models, types of roads, entirely new cities, and not just a copy and paste. Now we have bridges that move to let boats pass and stop traffic, and several landmarks in beautiful Dutch cities. This DLC, in my opinion, is proof that TML continues to develop its games continuously, just as SCS does with its games. I give a grade of 10 for this DLC, even more for the price that came to Brazil, proves that the company makes the so-called social conversion of the Dollar to our Real. Congratulations on the beautiful TML work. I leave my playlist, where I explore the cities of Holland and some of their vegetation/roads.

Yes.  .2 hrs on record.  Already know it's worth 3 bucks.  Why?  Bespoke gadget software is one of Sophie Houlden's greatest strengths.   You get a lovely piece of software to fiddle with cube puzzles with and it can act as a sort of fidget spinner if a certain kind of mouse clicker.    The design is well thought out and the color blind mode designs are fun even if you're not color blind.
I hate sliding puzzles and the girls in this game don't even look that good. Good thing is that I got this in a giveaway because I would never pay for this.
"2/10 98% of all games on steam are this, match games with boobs, asset flip, and those anime story games that people write in a day. nothing special that makes this stick out, played like 7 games just like it. into the hidden game abyss with you"
"Great aircraft, feels like abit of a brick at first but it actually turns well without blacking out and climbs like a beast. I primarily like to strafe and this is awesome. interior is sexy as hell and the sound of the engines when you go from low to high throttle is just joy. The only bad thing is you cant play a campaign unless you own bodenplatte but i will be waiting for the price to come down for that. Overall its great and also feels and looks unique, recommended."
These are the best looking outfits so far in my opinion. Land mine girl has nice panties.
"You need to either make OST available as a playlist for a normal player or make a proper player in-game if you want to limit players to only listening to OST in-game, it is incredibly inconvenient to  1. keep the game running to listen to the songs, and 2. manually playing them, like come on, guys.   The OST itself is beautiful, so I do recommend it, but usability is very bad for something that costs like an average game."
I got the DLC now and it's a S tier bundle
"This is doubtless the best owl-em-up of 2022 so far. The gameplay is fairly simple, but it actually gets reasonably challenging after awhile, around level 8-10. The main gliding mechanic is easy to pick up, but takes a decent amount of skill to master. It has a really fluid and satisfying sense of momentum once you get the hang of it.  The game doesn't punish you too much for losing a level, basically letting you keep the points you earn so you can buy stamina upgrades until you're able to clear the level. It doesn't feel grindy, though, since later levels give more points and you'll want to move on as soon as you're able.  There are a few different passive and active abilities to choose from, and a new game+ feature, which offers a bit of replay value. The low-poly art style is very well done, and all the animations look good. Overall it's a small but well-polished game that's well worth the $5."
"I loaded up the game and had trouble running it unless everything was either on ""Low"" or ""Medium"" settings. and after getting the acid and moving on to the third key for the giant door. it crashed 3 times and wouldn't load in."
Very fun and well-polished shmup with a satisfying challenge.

"Fantastic puzzle game, very original idea and smartly designed stages."
That guitar theme is my fav song forever and i finally found :D
"its a decent game, but the combat for sure kills it. It just isn't fun. i played for 20 odd minutes before uninstalling the game out of boredom. As a few other reviews said, it's basically left click. SOMETIMES middle mouse button and right click when ya need to swap. That's really it, the swinging animations could use a bit of work as well. Looks a little silly but eh. Again if the developer(s) could make it more interesting with something as simple as just combos or something. As well as maybe more than two or so enemies. Would be nice, may try the game again at another time if i see that it's been updated."
"I fell in love by the first time that I saw that game! Sir Lovet is a super fun game, beautiful and with a really cool soundtrack!  It’s a challenging game that remind Rayman in some moments.  If you like platform games, go forward.. because I’m sure that you have a really good time!"
"Interesting divisions, but the VDV division feels strange. Although I'm early in the game, both Iasi and Tiraspol campaign look very nice so far. Disappointed that there are no new maps. "
This game is cool !
Great addon! Keep it up Studio Polygon!
"i dont understand the purpose of this game, you can do nothing nothing at all so wat is the goal of this game or is there something i mist.???"

"Got 5 minutes to kill? just closed reddit, opened it again and thought why did i do that? play rank runner this game is the perfect way to waste time if you are struggling to think of a way to kill 5 minutes   it is a bullet hell you can only move forwards and backwards and you gotta try and get as far across the endless field I purchased this game on a whim cos i thought boy this is cheap and honestly the rank this is pretty cool and kinda unique its such a simple game, all you do is click ur mouse, and u dodge red arrows how hard can it really be? give it a go i cant recommend this enough to anyone who wants to play it casual or competitive"
"Game is fun as long as you don't enjoy watching your character. Start the game and walk away is the best way to play this.  Developer is awesome,."
the game is fun and cute there's so much content to explore but the control and tthe HUD quite messy hope tthe dev can make it less complicated
"I have pretty mixed feelings about the game and I'm not really sure if I can fully recommend it.   It has most of the things you'd normally expect from an eroge rom-com, but there's not that much depth to it. It's not really a nukige, but there's not really much development in each of the character's arcs, either.   Each character arc consists mostly of boring filler, H scenes, and then at the end of the arc there's some kind of ""plot development"" that is never anything serious and resolves very quickly and easily. None of the character arcs really had any substance and nothing about it was particularly memorable.   The main arc wasn't as bad, however, and was much more entertaining. Out of all of the characters, I would say that the three most entertaining and interesting characters were Inaba Usagi, Mitsuhashi, and Yuki, but the former two weren't even dateable characters, and Yuki's arc was probably one of the most disappointing of the four options, despite her being one of the best characters during the main arc. Taruhi and Kanon don't really have much depth and are basically the ""gullible/ditzy"" character and the ""hyper/energetic"" character, respectively; that's their entire personality. The last character, Shizuri, is basically just an ""ara ara onee-san"", which I'm not really complaining about, but it would have been nice for there to be more depth to her character. Her arc was probably the most enjoyable, but only because she's an ""ara ara onee-san"" and not because anything really interesting happened.   I don't really mind characters having simple personalities or fitting simple archetypes. That can be fine. For instance, the game NinNinDays by qureate is an example of that, where the female love interest is essentially a simple archetype with a simple personality. However, even if it's kind of simple, there's an actual story there and things ""happen"" in it. There needs to be some kind of development of the characters, or some kind of conflict and resolution in the story. The individual character arcs in Yukikoi Melt were just a sprinkling of misunderstandings, and then there was a little ""hurdle"" at the end of each of their arcs that was barely worth mentioning. Very little character growth in the portion of the visual novel that should have been focused on growing the characters.   The game assets from the CG's to the music were all very good and are what I would expect from Frontwing. The H scene artwork was also good, as well.   If you're just looking for a really simple story with little depth, with archetypes doing archetypal things, and if you're looking for a visual novel with some good H scenes, then you'll probably enjoy it. If you're coming from one of Frontwing's other games like Fruit of Grisaia, Corona Blossom, etc. then you'll probably be a bit disappointed. Frontwing is known for some really exceptional games with excellent stories and writing, but there's a few like Momoiro Closet that are more about the eroge rather than an interesting and gripping story. Yukikoi Melt falls into the latter category.   Yukikoi Melt is also on the longer side, so if all you want is some H CG by Nanaka Mai with a short and simple story to go along with it, you might be better off with Loca-Love My Cute Roommate than investing in a lengthy story that doesn't really go anywhere."
"It's like the snake I remember from my old Nokia phone but it has some cool twists, neat visuals that remind me of Matrix movies and the multiplayer for 2+ players is pretty fun!"
"Ive beat the game and all its side quest, except the unlimited fetch quest, and I can say that I like this game, I like the stealth, the infiltrating to enemy base part. Get the game"
"This is a very nice Hollywood economy simulation. I started loving these king of games since the early movie business on good´ol C64 followed by amigas Hollywood Pictures, The Producer to PC´s  Showtime, The Movies, and so on....... As there is an overall lack of quality within this kind of genre, i can definitely reccomend Tnseltown Tycoon!!! It´s a bit like Chart Wars, wich was also very entertaining, while beeing simple to its core.   There are a few buggy behaiviors if you try loading save games, wich can be solved by only loading from main menue.  I believe this game would be way more successful if it had a name related to its topic! (found it by accident;-)  Price Tag is good, as the developer should be rewarded for its work!!!!! 2 thumps up, from me!!!!!"
Have had much fun.Still some problems:1. annoying music 2. poorly designed sentry's and enemy's appearance 3. sentry types are not  enough for 9 days
"The game is pretty good. For casual players, it's quite easy to end the easy mode. And once you're done, if you really want to master it, there is room for improvement with the difficult and hard mode. I didn't clear it right now, but I will definitely continue to try.  I would clearly recommend it as an funny arcade game."
"Came here from Insym. Loved the game and decided to get it myself. Really love the art style, the jumpscares, the new ghost interactions in each game you play. Its just amazing! 10/10 recommended! Would love to see more maps maybe? Thanks"
chess if it was made by america
play music outside while door camping
Great Soundtrack for a great Game!
No mtx. No p2w. Doesn't have battle (hero) pass.
"epic remake of classic mc, definitely worth it to support for the small amount of dollars, even if you can get it for free on the website."
"What can I say that the ""About this game"" section hasn't said already? It's pretty hard, haha. Definitely harder than the first game. But the progression also feels better! If you like old school Metroid and Mega-man, this is a fun bit of nostalgia inspired gameplay."
"Very fun, already know I'm going to spend hours playing!"
Everypony in this game doesn't waste time.
"Just got done with the ""Alternate History"" Campaign.  It was short, extremely difficult.  You will need to bring your A game and Elite units.  I did like how the story coincides with the Japanese events, most likely Alternate History as well.  So looking forward to when the Pacific game finally comes out.  It did leave a tease at then end of this Campaign, I thought there would be more, but honestly I think there must be another expansion coming when the Pacific side comes out, as it was left rather open.  in all the 'Alternate History Campaign"" was challenging and the maps were great, huge in fact, and it was common to deploy 200+ Core points."

The DLC adds a folder in your game directory with 30 non-nude photos and 30 nude photos. The art style has an Anime feel to it, but not fully Anime girl. While the art is not horrible it is not something I would be using as wallpaper on a monitor either.  I DO NOT recommend purchasing this DLC as it is not needed for the game experience. However if you like the art style and want some wallpaper quality images it may be worth picking up on sale."
"i would recommend it but i would say you should  wait till its free,but for some it wont be free ,so buy it if you like the theme"
"Liberty Belle is a casual yet challenging platformer that appears to offer good value for its price, making it a viable option even for the Steam Deck. However, one notable issue is the inability to rebind the sprint function on a controller. Holding down the left stick on a PS5 controller resulted in discomfort, and I can only imagine this being worse on a Steam Deck. While the game does include an auto-sprint feature in the settings, it becomes problematic when navigating between moving obstacles, creating a strong need for either a toggle sprint option or the ability to rebind controls. The game also lacks Steam achievements, although hopefully they are added in the future. Overall a fun little game for its asking price.

time wasting game...just pay to no wait since the beginning...
"The game is pretty good, but its a bit boring if you don't have someone else to play with also the car can get bugged inside the map if you boost into the walls. also this entire review section is an irony."
Such a funny game. Just the random stuff makes it priceless. Very much worth a go.
"This game is VERY COOL. If you have kids who are interested in coding, this game definitely scratches that itch. Program your character properly to rescue your dad. Cute, voice acted, and fun, this is definitely worth a look for the educationally minded.  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ixwHP724So0"
"This game is really cute, but can be really hard! It say 2 hours of gameplay on the game page but took me almost 3 so i'm gladly surprised for that! The concept is good, but it seems that the sword was not always working as intended. This is a game made with smile game builder, so i can understand. Great game!"
"People who leave a negative review obviously didn't finish the game. You can't dislike this game after finishing. I bought this for the golden rot, it's worth it for me, I love rots."
"Obviously this is a semi-finished product.The user interface is too shabby，If the production team wants to sell more, you need to provide Chinese and price-matching game quality."
good art but no guide in anyway
Unfortunately the gameplay is by far worse than on my old scorched tanks version on the Amiga
"Just another great expansion, perfect!"
I will literally buy anything these guys put out
"Very poor pack. Very expensive for what it delivers. I am very disappointed. I'm returning it. Hopefully, they'll refund me.  With the refunded money, I'll try to buy a more useful pack."
This is easily their best dlc yet it has a very high production value. I understand ppl wanting more animals but unless they are ready to wait a year  for that to happen this is the best u will get even if they did an expansion u will still get 20 animals a year  but the game wont be updated in that while now u get 20 animals spread  over the period of a year whit a big free update to go whit every dlc i say this is the better deal and as far  as price goes it would be 40 dollars same as now
"It works now, I guess they fixed it  Apparently you need to beat missions upto a certain point to unlock the bottom and top parts? dunno how true that is, but if true its weird because all the other dlc you just get as soon as you log in.  (Old Review, was thumbs down) Avoid this DLC for now.... it isn't working properly. I got the bunny ears, but I don't see the tops nor bottom parts  I hope they fix it."
really bad graphices controls dont work  try a little harder before putting out there might help.even for early access this was bad
"That's a really nicely done loco. Good 3D model, sounds, physics. Few great details for immersion, like the hot plate. But unfortunately, the problem is always the same: gameplay. 55 minutes of new gameplay split between 4 timetable services, plus 3 normal scenarios. DTG should understand that this amount of gameplay is not acceptable. And considering that TSW2 scenario editor will not be usable on this or older DLCs, that's totally unacceptable. I couldn't recommend buying this.  EDIT: 17/07/2020 DTG just confirmed that ""based on community feedback"" preserved content will be usable on the new scenario/quickdrive planner. This of course does not change the gameplay situation of this DLC, but at least we will be able to create custom simple AtoB scenarios using this loco."
"RedEx is a ""template flip"", basically it's an asset flip where the ""developer"" made a game by copying + pasting a basic template for GameMaker Studio, putting some asset flipped sprites on it, and then put their own name on it to scam gamers into paying them for the work of someone else.  This time it's a basic 2D retro pixel platformer/shooter wave survival template.  A choice was made to use a template and sprite pack that has obsolete, decades old retro pixel ""art"" as a substitute for contemporary PC graphics.  It's unclear if this is due to lack of budget or talent, regardless, the overall visual quality of the game is extremely low as a result.  There's no options to change the resolution for the game or customise the graphics settings.  There's no way for gamers to ensure this is running at the native resolution of their displays... there's no guarantee this game will look right on any PC as a result of this hamfisted design decision.  There's no way for gamers to try improve the low quality graphics.   The controls can't be customised, which will be an annoyance for many, but it can also render the game unplayable for differently-abled gamers.  Some of the defects in the game can be attributed to the choice of using the GameMaker Studio construction kit/toolset.  This is a very poor quality toolset favoured by amateur developers as it's cheap and requires little in the way of development skill, but unfortunately has very limited capabilities.  Just as you can't make a silk purse out of a sows ear, you can't make a great video game if you use a terrible engine.  GameMaker Studio is often used to make retro pixel shovelware and cash grabs.  These technical defects push this game below acceptable standards for any modern PC game.  [quote][url=https://mmofallout.com/valve-bans-titles-for-review-manipulation/]Warning: Review Manipulation![/url][/quote]  This game features a number of fake positive reviews from accounts known to be in the business of review manipulation/paid reviews.  They're all written in either Russian or broken English, appear at almost exactly the same time, very shortly after the game launched on Steam, all have a direct Steam purchase of the game, and the accounts are used consistently to write fake reviews for asset flips and other cash grabs/scams.  The ""Positive"" review score on this game should be disregarded due to this blatant, unethical review manipulation.  This is done to deceive and scam gamers into paying for a bad product.  RedEx has an overly optimistic price of around $5 USD, it's not worth it given the defects and shortcomings with the product, especially considering the sheer number of completely free, much higher quality games on Steam, and the unethical nature of the developer."
"What a great game, with the graphical style of the old Lords of midnight games"
"[h1]The game lacks surprises[/h1]  Larcin Lazer is a game with a cool atmosphere! The problem is that it feels under-exploited.   Only the last level (jungle) really offers a challenge that lives up to my expectations. The structure of the various levels reminded me of Spelunky, with its biomes of all kinds in which gameplay mechanics are specific to the environment.  The game design and level design should have gone further, creating a greater sense of reward and surprise for the player.    A good game, but we're left wanting more.   [b]14/20[/b]"
"Very well done, also the BR 423 and the BR 403. Some FPS problems in the Munich station."
"This bundle is complete shit. The only song worth considering in the entire Monstercat Music Pack is “Overkill”. Even that song sucks, but it’s the only one that actually felt like I was playing on Expert+ difficulty. All of these songs are terrible choices for this game, and the flow and sync make me think that the Beat Saber devs brought in their D Team to map these ones. I mean really, the songs from the base game are so good, but these feel like they were either sourced from someone who lacks any kind of rhythm, or they were rushed as a cash grab. Either way… avoid."
"The other cheat/extras DLC for Estellium Legends, this one gives you the catboy protagonist of Falnarion Tactics II, Tolem Felstein.  Unlike Ether, though, Tolem is a mediocre class, and the most notable thing about him is that you can steal his unique sword - which is way better here than it is in his own game! - and give it to another sword-wielder if you want. Unfortunately, sword-wielders aren't good in Estellium Legends, so that's also pretty much a wash. This one comes with three ""win any fight instantly"" buttons, but you really shouldn't need five of them. I didn't really see the need for any, myself.  As an upside, the ero-pictures are much better-drawn than they were in the first Boom Pow Pack, but spending $4 on two lewd pictures and a naked character profile doesn't seem like a great idea to me, I didn't use the Doom Blasters, and the catboy is neither useful nor that unique. Can't recommend this one."
"[b] Target Audience: [/b] Very new players to the SHMUP genre......maybe. [I] [/i]  [b] Summary: [/b]    There are times as a reviewer where you have to step back and wonder if you're being too hard on a game. You want to be critical, but you don't want to be unfair. There were several moments with Paper Nebula that I sat there wondering if recent other games impressions and the lack of pizzaz from the game was really making me think it was this bad. Maybe that's still the case, but frankly Paper Nebula did nothing to impress me in the SHMUP genre. The paper airplane model and some of the visuals are ok, but what I found time and time again were decisions that made my head tilt, to the point where you might as well call me Reagan from the Exorcist.  For a high action shmup, the game surprisingly has a lack of pace that keeps the fighting going with definite pauses in actions as the next set of enemies come on screen, but worse is the fact that once you get a hang of seeing the limited enemy patterns on screen, you can probably kill a good amount of them before they get one bullet out. There's a few enemy types that get recycled a whole hell of a lot, and the bullet patterns start to get repetitive even in the first few reruns of the levels. Bosses are probably the highlight, but even then you find that there are times where the game says “nah, you dead” because you don't know how the enemy moves, and the game doesn't even give invincibility time after taking a hit to reset. The weird thing is, the game is easy when you know what's coming: almost comically easy. But you will still die because the game punishes mistakes hard especially early on, and it's hard to know what you're supposed to learn from, it.  Then, the repetition sets in. Let's be clear: every SHMUP has repetition. But you add variety with different weaponry, reactionary patterns, and various other tools to help keep the gameplay fresh, especially with a game that's indicating it has “roguelite” elements. Paper Nebula fails miserably here: playing through the first level for the 5th time is a slog, and with no power ups in the game other then outside upgreade systems, it feels like you're just mashing the fire button. Which you probably are: because the default option to turn on auto-firing is slow, and with some of the needed frequency with bosses, you don't want to use it.  I'm more just baffled at some of the other decisions though. Explosions can be so strong and take up the screen enough to block out a ton of bullets that when you die from it, you're wondering how you could have seen what was coming. You'll wonder why the game chooses at the start of the 7th level to automatically kill you, almost making you walk away from the game before realizing that it was for “story?” purposes (I think, I honestly don't know). Then you wonder for a game with a permanent upgrade system, why finishing the first run locks the save file to show you the credits repeatedly.   It's just boring. At the price tag in question, you can get games that do a ton more then Paper Nebula does with more fun and excitement. NeverAwake. ZeroRanger.  Bullet Heaven 2. I'm the one whose been on record, mind you with a lot of criticism, that indie games are under priced now a days for the effort that it takes to ship a game. And let's be clear: Paper Nebula tries and there's love and effort put into it. But when everyone at the same price tag around you is blowing you out of the water, I can't give it a recommend. It's a pass.   [b]Review Video:    [/b]	https://youtu.be/nUutacm5dK8				   [u] Lists: [/u] [b]Positives:[/b] [list] [*] First 10 minute impression was good.

"Funny and involving, needless to say: perfect fit for these next weeks! Kinda takes you back to older times, yourself younger, no responsabilities, your console, cosy times at home, family, gifts and love. And now rock'n'roll and evil x-mas gang! Art style and music on point, not too long but it is challenging and it will make you come back for that quick easy daily pleasure! What do you want more?!"
Atrocious value for money. A 3 minute non-interactive trailer. Rubbish. Avoid.
"Loved the art style and the bright colors this game brings. However as others have said - the controls seem clunky and not responsive in the fighting side of things. Also the falling petals in the levels became a bit much with such bright colorful moving backgrounds. I found myself bored if I'm honest - and I think that came from the fighting now being fulfilling to me.   ""more repetitive than fun"" PAA Community Member"
"One of the most creative tower defense games I've played recently. Already has enough content to play for a good few hours, and considering that we'll have two more classes on the way, it's still got tons of potential."
"An alright jigsaw game with cute dogs with color splashes (as the title implies) as the images. There is 50 different jigsaws ranging from 9 to 49 pieces. I only really had one issue with it which is that the sound mute button only mutes the music, you can still hear the sound effects.  It works without any issues on Linux with Proton (8.0-3)."
"I'm glad it was only $1 b/c its probably not even worth that, its maybe 4 minutes of fun at most, there are no numbered levels or holes to progress thru.  It lacks basic things like an exit button to quit the game,  I had to force close it thru task manager.  Would not recommend!!!"
I know it's hard creating a game and I respect you for trying but there is a ton of improvements to be made. The audio is loud and the graphics/ story line doesn't make sense. Just a bit all over to be honest.
"great story, and decent little rpg game for the price i recommend."
"EDIT: The day after I posted this, there was an update!  Executions are now doable while in free-camera after a Parry, that's great! :D Also, Thunder Bolt's sound has been fixed. Thank you, devs, very much! I changed my review.   I suggest you buy it on sale.  It's a fun game with good combat mechanics that feel real. Like Dark Souls, you'll be dodging and waiting for the opportune moment to strike, until you're super powered up that you can plow through the enemies. It's rewarding. A completed run of the game will take about 30-40 minutes. There are some alternate paths that cut a section, making it faster. It has some good replayability, as roguelikes must have.  Here are some things I did not particularly enjoy: - It's all about the Power RNG. The game relies too much on RNG to be a great Roguelike. Some runs will be cut short due to not having enough Powers, since the altars didn't give them to you, making it hard to progress. Didn't get a good weapon in the first two areas? It might now takes you 1 minute to kill every enemy in the 3rd. Better to just die and restart.  Other times you get everything you need very fast and it goes very smoothly.   - I haven't been able to perform any ""teleports"", like the ones the Blink Sword says, as well as a Power that says ""My next melee attack is a teleport, after a perfect dodge"". Maybe I don't understand what a ""Teleport"" is, or maybe I'm doing it wrong. I don't know!  I did enjoy it, all in all. I bought it on sale, and I spent a good amount of time in it. I'm happy with what it offered, but would not recommend it full price. I easily looked past the graphics and the sound quality (I just had my own music on).   If you can find it on sale, I recommend it! :)"
"***This review contains MAD SPOILERS***  It's subjective, but if you're looking to get scared, this game does a pretty good job of making that happen.  Unfortunately, that's the best thing I can say about it. It's a collection of unsettling environments wrapped in a buggy walking simulator. It severely lacks both polish and direction. The visuals could use some work in a lot of areas, particularly on scene transitions. However, what bothered me the most was the story, because the game puts so much emphasis on it.  The story is subpar. It basically follows a group of four friends. They formed a club in high school and were pretty cool with each other, then they randomly decided to explore an abandoned train station. One of them ends up getting run over by a train... that was apparently being driven by a crazy hobo scientist. Somehow. The rest of the friends went their separate ways for 7 years, before getting kidnapped by that same hobo and forced into VR headsets. The VR headsets force you to sleep and are capable of killing you in real life. They are also somehow hooked up to some magical brain-crystals, which were created in a lab by that hobo before he became a hobo. The friends are tasked with overcoming their personal demons, which are scary and frightening. Eventually they do, only to find out that the whole reason they were doing this was so they could get over themselves, because apparently they can't be possessed by dead kids while they still have emotional baggage. Fortunately, only one of the dead kids was trying to possess them, but the only thing she was able to accomplish was killing that hobo. Somehow. Yeah, he's dead now. The rest of the dead kids go ahead and let the protagonists escape from VR. Oh, and their dead friend who got run over by a train was there... but then he died again. The friends decide to become friends again, and idly wonder if the police will ever find those brain-crystals... which are still at large... because, I don't know, they can move or something? They're rocks.  Trust me, I worded that the best way I could. Much of the story is awkwardly worded and awkwardly paced. It constantly skips back and forth between the present and the past within an array of ""dreams"" the characters are having, interspersed with not-particularly-well-done dialogue. Characters frequently blurt out things that seem either out of character or inappropriate for the situation. At first, you play it off as glitches in the VR simulation, but eventually you realize the writing just isn't good.  Speaking of the characters, only one of them has a proper backstory fleshed out, that character being Liam. This concerns me because he's not really the main protagonist, but since he's the only character you know anything about by the end of the story, he feels as if he is. He had problems with his career and his marriage due to problems with his father, and he wasn't dealing with any of it in the best way. Okay, well done. What about everyone else? Well, you find out about Thomas (the actual main character) and his issues with his father, but you never delve into what he's been doing for the past 7 years. He's peeping on some girl through a telescope, but that's never explored. You find out about Aubrey's social anxiety, but you get conflicting information concerning her grandmother. Did she kill her grandmother? I don't know, they conveniently cut to a different scene when she was about to talk about it. Which, by the way, she was doing while standing directly over Thomas's blood-covered body (he got hit by a virtual train), but apparently him being dead wasn't important enough to influence the conversation. Aaron has some connection to the hobo and the underground experiments, maybe, but he's the one that got run over by a train in real life, and when you get run over by a train, we officially stop caring about your life.  ...oh yeah, I forgot to talk about the gameplay. Well, what happens is that you have a sprint button, but that sprint button doesn't actually do anything. So you walk around in the dark using the arrow keys, looking for little white dots. Every area is always dark all the time, so you're stuck looking at a small circle on your screen for 95% of the game. Occasionally, a puzzle will pop up, and then a rather disinterested monster will lazily follow you around as you try to solve it. You can't fight most of the time, but that's okay, because you're both too fast and too thicc for anything to be of any serious danger to you, anyway. I said the game was scary, I didn't say it was hard.  On the merits of simply being a 2D horror game, it works, and I will say it's worth the asking price when it's on sale. It just doesn't deliver on anything else. This would have been a better game if they just didn't bother with cutscenes at all and just let the game be a long series of disconnected scares."
"Many graphically distinct asset packs for RPG maker often don't have everything that you need, and will force you to frankenstein stitch together other mismatched assets (or try to replicate the art style in creating your own assets) in order to cover all of your bases.  This DLC however, actually manages to cover just about everything one would want graphics-wise (the custom fonts being a nice touch), and with a good sense of variety as well. The only real thing I had to go out of my way to get was sound design that's cohesive with the art style.  All-in-all, I love this pack. Really appreciated the sample maps and database as well.  "
"The idea is there, but the game hardly does anything to account for quality of life such as keyboard bindings and video options. Additionally, when searching for the secrets and crayons, it's very difficult to tell what's a secret and what's simply just unfinished and unbounded nonsense. Additionally, when looking into the game files, it appears that some of the steam achievements for this game aren't even tracked. Overall, just a very unpolished and neglected game."
"I like tactical turn based game, the one with a very big storie and a nice storytelling. But I'm disappointed with the storytelling a lot. Here... it's perfect, almost no storytelling, so no disappointement. Just a tactical fined tuned turned based game. It goes directly to the point. No equipement, no bigger choice to make then choose your 3 heroes and a leader. Then it's all about tactical choices. All heroes are very different with 3 actives skills and one passive at the end. There is a lot of status debuf and some status buff, which make the game very tactical also. Because you can be only affected by one statuts... the last one. That's tricky and very enjoyable. Nice little game, with some depth despite being simple at first glance. Need a bit of tuning for some heroes that are a bit lacking in my opinion. Else it's really cool. (Played on pre-released version, with all 3 area unlocked and all heroes at disposal.)"
"Very nice game, free to play ^^"
"Like a lot of people here, I’ve been waiting for the full version of this game for what seems like forever.    I feel the wait was worth it!  I absolutely love this game.  I would spend way more time in the world if my controllers would quit needing to be charged and my head could deal with being in the box longer.  I enjoyed the ‘quest’ part with the exception of [spoiler]the gnome tunnels as the bump movement makes that part extremely difficult.  I also think it would be a great idea to allow people to skip the chase portion as this game would seriously appeal to young players minus that sort of intense encounter.  I just think it would be too scary for some young players.[/spoiler]  The open world part is fabulous.  Seriously, I can’t imagine a more charming way to spend a few hours than strolling about the trees, waving at smiling goblins [spoiler]or serving fruit brews in the pub or playing ‘darts’ with the jovial folks [/spoiler]around you.    During the current stresses in the world.  This game is a blessing. Thank you so much for completing it!"
"At the start the game was brilliant, but as it progressed it started to become obvious that it is incredibly poorly balanced with Boss level timers are too tight. Furthermore, there have been 2 very pesky bugs: You can serve raw pies; and even worse you prefer to do that as from Stage 2, games fails to realise that you are trying to place bread or pies onto the oven trays and instead it yeets the dough in the maid.   As soon as these two bugs and balancing is addressed I would be delighted to highly recommend the game. Until now I sincerely believe that the game-play will feel more frustrating than enjoyable after a certain level."
"Zooma VR von Gizmo VR LTD ist genau das! Zooma in VR.  Genau wie in den Flatvarianten schießen wir, hier aber mit zwei Farbballpistolen, auf farbige Bälle-Schlangen. Zum Gameplay muss ich bei diesem Klassiker ja nicht viel schreiben, nur soviel - auch in der VR-Version gibt es Goodies zu sammeln. Ein Vorteil ist es auch, dass wir uns in Roomscale bewegen können, um so den besten Schusswinkel zu suchen.  https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=1973522722 https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=1973523526 Zooma VR bietet zur Zeit zwei Welten mit jeweils zehn Level, mehr Content soll aber wohl noch folgen, schaut man sich das z.Zt. noch nackte Menü an .  Mehrere Updates haben viele Fehler behoben und neuen Contet dazugebracht.   Dafür das Zooma VR umsonst ist, macht es richtig Laune.  https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=1973521443 Zooma VR macht genauso viel Spaß, wie die Flatversionen, wenn nicht sogar mehr!

Zooma in VR.  Exactly like in the flat variants we shoot, here however with two color ball guns, at colored ball snakes. I don't have to write much about the gameplay of this classic, just this much - even in the VR version there are goodies to collect. Another advantage is that we can move around in Roomscale to find the best shooting angle.   Zooma VR currently offers two worlds with ten levels each, but more content will follow, if you take a look at the currently still naked menu.

rubbish cant get train to move to complicated to move it
"Would I recommend this game? If you like silly puzzle games that can challenge you at times, absolutely, as long as you're not in it for story realism. Who plays these games for that, though?   Would I recommend that they unlock all of the chapters without me having to wait 2 hours for a new key? Again absolutely. It's a game that was originally an app so microtransactions galore. If you're like me and you hyperfocus on a game, this one will be incredibly frustrating. Just as you're getting into the story, boom.  You're out of keys and finished a chapter.   I get that the game is free so the devs need to make their money somewhere. But I'd rather pay for the game upfront and have everything unlocked.  SN: If you're thinking about playing it on the Steam Deck, I wouldn't really recommend it. It runs great. But the puzzles and game are very point and click. When you're on a Steam Deck, that is a little cumbersome.   Game on!"
"The Best VR Hockey game there is right now. It's a ton of fun thanks to the great community and the devs are really cool, definitely worth a buy."
"Donno why the Pie Empire upgrade isnt called the EmPIEre , trash game"
Fix your game first
"Nice visuals, but the handling needs much tweaking"
"ingame steam overlay / f12 to screenshot dont work, but still funny little game lmao."
"Feels well balanced, game gives you lots of options but it feels like I have to play semi optimal, punished for bad plays."
"Amazing game, been following the developer since June 2019.  This game is amazing and unique!"
"The developer always gives away the new DLCs for free for a limited time, and they are loved for it. It's a great way to reward your most enthusiastic players and build community goodwill."
"The game is great but it has been broken for nearly a year and I do not see it ever getting fixed.  There is a bug which causes FH4 to crash to desktop as soon as you try to get past the main menu and every solution I have seen I have tried and none of them have fixed it. It seems to be a common problem, there are plenty of people posting on the boards with the exact same problem - apparently the version on the Microsoft store works fine, this is a problem solely with the Steam version.  The devs say ""open a support ticket"" but the people who do have them closed and they are told to go to steam instead. I appreciate that this is an old game but when it is still being sold I think it is fair to expect that you are actually able to play it."
a great update to the game of chess
"Link the Animals is a ripoff of a basic mobile game template using Unity.  It's a simple puzzle game where you put your finger on an object and trace a path to the other object in that pair, and repeat the process without running over any of the existing paths.   I've played a few games using this same Unity template.   A few reviewers have commented that they think this is malware because of high CPU and GPU usage, although I couldn't verify that, so I'll jump to the developers aid here and suggest it's just really badly optimised, but then what do you expect for a mobile app that's been lazily dumped on Steam, possibly because the app stores wouldn't take it because of some strange thing they have called ""QA"".   Anyway, lulzy bad mobile app tier game/asset flip kind of stuff, you can play this kind of thing free on mobile, so why bother paying for this one on Steam?"
"Okay. Looks like no one is going to say it so I will say it. This game has potential, its monsters are cute yet cool, it has fusions alongside evolutions, a catching mechanic that doesn't need you to constantly go in and out of the store to buy some item and the story is interesting from what I have seen. I cannot wait to see what else the devs are going to add to the game in the future. Flaws:  English translation. But I will give the devs a break since English is clearly not their native language and I was able to understand what the characters were saying. I know how expensive it can be to hire people to translate a game. Price: talking about expensive, I don't think the price, as for now, should be so high.I think the price for the game should be around US$15-US$18. There is no option to go back to the screen menu. I think this should be available."
"In this video I take a look at Amanda's Sticker Book 2 - Amazing Wildlife an enjoyable match three game primarily for the Tween market or any fan of match threes. It's well made and I give it a decent work out in my video so watch the video to see what the game is like for yourself.... https://youtu.be/MCzFZAvdX_0 Check'n Games, providing you with as many Let's Play's as we can. Thanks for watching. Please like comment and subscribe."
Very good game. Fun to try out different builds. Fun to battle.  Sverige Glad!
Very Cool tribe. Has different mechanics and can freeze enemy units which is great if you are surrounded. Once I was surrounded by many CPU's but I made it out since I could freeze them. Also they have units which can speed up on the ice.
"Quite a difficult game, constantly forcing you to move forward due to the mechanics of increasing complexity. But I liked it. Hardcore players will definitely like it. At first glance, it looked like a terrarium, but the fact that half of the game takes place with a view from above, and completely different accents in the gameplay make it a completely independent product. I approve of this decision"
Very neat
I highly recommend this game to anyone who like codes or even someone who just wants a challenge. This game is put together great and honestly is the best free game I have found on steam.
"I don't know much about puyo puyo but my wife and I had fun playing this game, which is apparently very similar to it. Originally played it on Antstream but then wanted a local version so I could play local multiplayer on it (Antstream doesn't support local multiplayer for it yet)."
 promising little RTS nice art and voice acting
Good touhou game but the sound you make when freezing bullets pierces my ears in an extremely painful way.   This game is best when muted which is awful because zun's music is great.
"I'm about a few hours in, and I have to say I really enjoy this game, although there are some areas I feel could do with some polishing.   1. Ship Storage / Cargo Management - the loading time breaks the seamless gameplay, is there a way to remove loading time? Also, a huge quality of life improvement would be to have more detailed mouse-overs on items. I can't tell how many credits I'm looting, what is the level of the laser weapon, etc etc.  2. Auto-eat / Auto-sleep: a threshold before a crewmember (not in combat) will go to eat / sleep on their own would be extremely appreciated.  3. Starmap improvements - currently you can only select ""dock"" or ""jump"" in the starmap, can we get a ""go to target"" for asteroids? I keep having to manually select the go-to target on the main ship view and it's really hard for clustered targets.  "
"[h1]Before I played Super Foosball, I had a small pp, no friends, no gf, depression, and no life. These things havent changed, but the game is pretty good[/h1]"
not made for humans to hear see or play i have no idea what is happening and my ears hurt
Noctem is a a survival horror adventure that takes place in a dark mansion. The environment is amazing and the atmosphere is sure to intimidate anyone who dares investigate the secrets that hide within these walls. 
"It's a solid little enjoyable experience hopping from universe to universe trying to catch a criminal. Not sure if I would recommend it if it were a paid experience, but as a free game its definitely worth spending some time with to see the different universes and events."
"This Indie Horror Game has a lot of effort put in, clever game mechanics, nice soundtrack, vocals and music, the puzzles can take a bit to figure out but aren´t hard. When you enter the maze of the game, make sure to follow the blood trails because you can get lost easily and chased by the creature of nightmares, which is nicely designed. The backgrounds and assets are really something else and the story is well told. This is only a prologue and I´m excited to see more of your work as usual Aaron! Keep up the great work~"
"So far I have only tried to win as the Allies in the first scenario provided -  Operation Olympic (the first phase of the invasion of Japan), and the best I have managed (after 3 attempts) is a draw against the AI. I have now set the AI to maximum difficulty and am not doing very well - I will have to up my game. Both sides can be played against the AI.  This is a good wargame which challenges me and on an interesting topic. Graphics are very reasonable and sound effects functional. I have not experienced any bugs or crashes so far.  I would have liked the manual (which is quite extensive) to explain exactly how the difficulty levels are managed, for example is the AI given more firepower, extra units, or is it just plain smarter? - But otherwise no complaints. "
"Wacky adventures with charming characters are a good time! All the characters function rather uniquely so it's interesting to play around with your party composition to see how they can all work together. Some relatively early areas could be a little tough to navigate but once you push through that, new characters trickle in pretty quickly. On hard mode, some bosses could be tough and were like a puzzle to figure out but you can try again quickly so it's pretty forgiving. Once you've made it partway through the game, you have a lot of tools to play with to change up your strategy and solve these challenges. Worth a try if you want something a little offbeat!"
"your use of this software is subjected to the following policies, agreements and terms, including transfer of your data to countries that may have different levels of privacy protection than your own. i disagree to all game crashes 0/10!!! what a waste of a download."
"Fun, feels good to play. Also feels more like Dragon Warrior Monsters than Porkeymans with the fusing and random exploration."
"I have not played much of this game yet, but often you can tell if you are going to enjoy playing a game or not very quickly after a few levels. I really enjoyed what I played in this and will continue playing. It reminded me of a geometry version of Super Meat Boy. I was playing with the keyboard, but will probably play with a controller next time I load it up."
"You can just play this in the background and chill while doing your homework or studying, or work from home. Fun and cute game!"
good but laggy asf for my pc
"it's great, but would still be cool to get the complete OST like it's uploaded on spotify"
"While I enjoy the core aesthetic and idea for the game, there are just some inexcusable downsides that left a sour taste. I know this is a demo, so there is room for improvement, but my initial impression is that the devs put this up too hastily.  Negatives:  - Audio is far too quiet  - Responsiveness was awful, why is nothing happening when I am pressing the correct button at the right place and time? Even the menus are slow... Should be fixed ASAP  - The tips and hints system was not that thorough, there needs to be more info; dedicate tutorial screens or something to discuss the UI and some mechanics (like Sharpness or the Swordcery for each sword)  - Gameplay was not balanced: Sword swinging takes WAY too long with some of the shorter swords, and makes overall sword balance poor between variants. I ended up using the Eternal Blade (or whatever the two-handed long one is) that does wide long-range attacks and that one is completely broken as you can attack from super far away and deals high damage  - Boss fight was ridiculous, I cannot tell if the devs intentionally meant to put that hard a boss in the demo, but it was not one you should be facing that early: either decrease its difficulty by limiting its movements and abilities or allow the 'Dodge' mechanic to actually pivot you around the enemy like you can in Dark Souls so you can land attacks of opportunity   - Music was kind of dull after a while, there needs to be a more diverse soundtrack for a full release  - Seriously, you only get one health potion from the shop and that's it?!  - Loading time to spawn in takes a bit too long, I get there is random generation, but it should be faster  - My own opinion, but the default button layout on gamepad was mediocre, I would prefer having to press a combo of buttons for some of the moves rather than mapping everything to a different button  Positives:  - Randomly generated, so you get new maps each time you spawn in  - Color pallet is nice  - Decent diversity of enemies, could use more variants here or there though  - Generous loot after beating each section  - Free to play  Other than that, the devs need to do more to optimize and balance the game before a full release, otherwise I do not see many people playing this over others in this genre."
"It's one song, and it's kinda decent, or semi-decent. Nothing special really, but it's a piece of free fan service.   And Idle Champions has a great community, which is rarely seen in today's games (and basically never in the idle genre).   Thumbs-up for the whole community thing and the relationship the dev team has with the fans, which this package is only a tiny peace of."
"Rough and still unpolished for today's players, but it does have potential for people looking for a whiff of nostalgic old school games."
"2022.5.22 update to 1.2.9,i can launch now!     the software won't launch on my computer, please fix this.version：1.2.3  update to 1.2.4 ,this software is still unable to launch system version:windows 10 Realtek Audio 用户界面语言：简体中文(simplified Chinese)  i wonder the bug is from language.  2022.4.29 update to 1.2.5 unable to launch"
Actually incredible.
"First off, 3 things I want to mention I have Dyslexia - Reading is not Easy nor Fun for me. I am not a VN Player, not my thing, and 3rd thing is: I am not a VN Fan, so please be careful when sending me a VN to review (however I will probably do it, just cause). That being said, let's get started on my opinions on this Prologue.   First things first, want to mention it looks like there is a bunch of work still needing to be done and that H-Scenes are going to happen. Now if they mean real Eroge scenes (Sexually Graphic) I do not know, people say Hentai or H-Scene and think it means porn, Hentai Means Pervert in Japanese. Eroge is Sexual Content, Ecchi is Slightly Sexual but no penetration or that sorta thing, like panty shots and nudity, that is Ecchi. KEEP THIS IN MIND WHEN THE GAME IS FULLY RELEASED, incase you want a game with no sexual content (most anime games get that slapped on it anyway... I do not think sexual content is that big of a deal, sex is natural, but whatever, some people are prudes).  Menus: Easy to navigate, TONS of Options, I hope there is even more when the game is fully released as this prologue only has up to EP. 1's end. There are so many options though, like font change, text color change, font size, text allignment and tons more. So many options that I nearly forgot I was reviewing a game and thought I was doing my next English paper for college. Music/Sound: SUPER LOUD, needs to be balanced, heard the same song about 8 times in the first episode, needs a little more variety. I suggest taking inspiration from K or K-Project as their music was some of the best in an Anime that I have seen. Characters: Generic to Anime, but high change you will find someone you will like a little more than you probably should. that being said, Good Art design on them, I actually really liked it, most VN's I reviewed and have seen the art is so basic, but this was a little rough around the edges at times and I really liked it, it was still immersive. Voice Acting: not the best, a 6.5/10 if you ask me. I have heard better, but for a free game, not going to complain about it. Story: pretty good, lots of nice places to see, good art with it, makes me wish I was in this town to explore it.  game has over 150 save slots, seems excessive, but I guess that is useful to save every moment you can so you do not mess up, I have seen that in VN's a lot, so it is natural. But for me who plays mostly Sci-Fi, Action, Adventure, Open World and War games, it was weird seeing that, but also made me wish more game devs would have excessive save slots in their games.  If this game DOES get H-Scenes, I recommend updating this prologue with a demo of a few, it could help sales, just a gallery type thing to re-experience all those scenes (for those into that sorta thing, which I am, but I do not like doing reviews of games with Adult Content, however I will if I need to).  last few things to mention: 1) Japanese Art with ENG Voices is Cringy to me (there is no Japanese Voice Option, sadly) 2) Do not select Japanese in the Options as it just changes the text to Japanese 3) Japanese + English words over options or instructions is confusing I have dyslexia and as someone who reads Japanese (studied for 6 years at college level) and is a English Speaker, this was really confusing as my brain was fighting what to read. 4) There is a nice bit of interactivity with the characters in many scenes however I wish there was a gallery of sorts to have those images and facial expressions to view over and over good game for SCIENCE and RESEARCH.   Thus concludes my review of this VN. I would not buy it myself. HOWEVER (H-content willing I would buy it HAHAHA) I would recommend this to a LOT of friends as I know this is something they like. 8/10 - decent game all around, really nice art, a bit too many recycled backgrounds and songs over and over, makes the town seem extra small. Cute females, generic looking males, not a single japanese looking girl in any of these games (love their natural look, brown or black hair with brown eyes, it is cute) but the girls are all nice. Id get it to try it while it is free, it is decent and worth checking out if the tags are anything you normally play."
"Absolute masterpiece of a game, 10/10 from me. I will look back fondly on this game for years to come. And I am going to be interested in anything else Keizo comes up with."
Super fun is abit rough but overall smooth and relaxing to play with friends / randoms
"game is broken, won't even load anymore. Sad..."
"A simple tag game, but difficult to achieve. If you increase the speed on the way, you can not escape. Please learn me the tips."
SO GOOD!!! this is sooooooo fun and cool! great concept please work on it more in the future!
"City Breaker is a great VR game! Its mechanics are pretty easy to grasp (many of my family members who tried the game had an easy time with it), but relatively difficult to master. The game feels rewarding to play, and it's just a lot of fun! Definitely a good purchase for anyone with a VR headset, although make sure you're ready to throw stuff! :D"
"It's ok. Game itself is fun, but it has bad performance and if you die you have to replay from the beginning which sucks. Also it's very short. But it's free, so why not try it?"
Cannot use search bar in editor to change nationality or teams
"This game reads...interestingly. Treat it like an over the top anime where you play a helpless tsundure character. Because honestly, it seems like that was wholeheartedly the intention. You're always the baby of the group, and you honestly start to feel like kind of a spectator of the story.   You also somehow have a heavy dose of protaginitis in this one, you always feel special and unique despite not proving it. I have yet to run into a failure state and I don't know how to feel about that. The game feels like one long tutorial stage. I also notice there are barely any skill uses in this game. It didn't feel like my skills were relevant to the story in the slightest. The only time it felt relevant was when I assume the game looked for my highest value to determine my soulstone.  Also the game obviously wants you to be friends with the side characters but that makes dialogue with them kind of brain dead. What reason do I have to be a dick to my protectors? Why don't I have different dialogue options, each designed to be positive, but only one has a better outcome than the others. As it stands, I have no reason to be a dick to my friends and I'm romancing one specific character so I always know to pick the friendliest option on the list.  The game is book 1 of a series but it doesn't end as its own story, like I prefer. It ends on a clfiffhanger that makes you realize you held on for some resolution that didn't come. Oh also you only get your soul stone at the END of the story."
"This is a very engaging logical puzzle game that makes you feel very smart when you get a solution. Excellent level design, and a wonderfully calming experience."
"Runnyk is a platforming adventure game that will delight you from beginning to end with the adorable characters and enemies, the tight and effective combat, and it's ease.  It's a very short game, even when attempting to 100% the whole deal, but it's the perfect game to take bites out of over time or to complete all in one go!  Video review here: https://youtu.be/BsYgoelWEyw?t=72 [Timecode 1:13 for Runnyk Review]"
"I just finished playing through the game on stream and would like to leave a little review.  To clear the game, it took me about 2 hours.  This is by no means a long game, but that doesn't mean a bad game either.  The Good - The Platforming is great!  There are some more challenging things, but nothing excruciating.   - Some of the runes are challenging to get and not handed to you on a silver platter.  You need to put in some work to get them. - You get to go hunting for treasures without feeling like it's a chore.  There are hidden areas to find that contain health ups, runes, and currency to unlock the runes.  The Bad - Combat is a smidge clunky, BUT IT DOES NOT RUIN THE GAME.  I emphasize this, because I don't want you to not play the game because of the combat.  The combat works, it just doesn't feel fluid. - The timer for one of the puzzles in the fire section needs to be longer.  After several attempts, I was able to finally get it, but not by using the method you guys expected.  The tornadoes are to inconsistent to determine the jumps.  Ultimately, it isn't a bad game.  I enjoyed playing my way through it.  If you are looking for a long story based game, this isn't for you.  If you want something casual though, give this a shot!  Based on the description, this game was made by a small group of graduates.  Keep up the good work and keep improving!  I hope to see your team put out some more games together.   I'll update this review with a youtube video put out after my 24 hour exclusivity is up from twitch."
"I have been very excited for this collection and so far the games are very fun! One major issue im running into is weird vsync stutter on moving objects on screen, so far the fix is to disable full screen optimizations but this has only worked on the main client excluding individual games that so far all seem to have similar issues."
I had fun and I bought it for 5 bucks.Money well spent!!
had more fun in this than battlefield 2042
Very fun game to pass the hours!
"[quote=]If you find this review helpful be sure to thumbs up and follow my [url=https://store.steampowered.com/curator/33195105/] Curator Page [/url]. If I missed something leave a comment and I will try to update the review asap[/quote]  [h1] Light Tracer 2: Bright ambition that needs some more work.  [/h1]  Light Tracer 2 is a Puzzle solving RPG that needs a lot of reworking for its core gameplay loop though conceptually is a great idea for a game.  [h1]Gameplay[/h1]  Starting with the puzzles in game, they are for the most part really clever and well thought out. Some of them get really involved and take some consideration to find a solution, with some benefiting from using this second god type character to get a view of the puzzles and help you see things from a better perspective, other puzzles though are much simpler and often have exploits that weren't intended by the player to do. While playing you are encouraged to explore the environments to get items for crafting recipes but more often than not it ends up being a redundant task as early on you aren't a strong character so going out of your way to get these resources means you'll fight creatures that out number and often overpower you meaning when you do kill the creatures you'll often end up low on health and your reward is a often nothing useful to recoup the cost of the battle. While fighting enemies and doing puzzles you gain XP/Currency that you can use to level up your player, gain new abilities or progress the games story and that's where things get bothersome. The biggest issue in the game is that your characters XP/Upgrade points are using the same currency for the progression of the games story, so it becomes a game of ""do you want to level up, or unlock the next area?"", because of this you're often just burning through the game by doing puzzles, getting just enough XP/Currency to progress to the next puzzle, then after finishing 6 puzzles you can either level up your character or go to the next island or optionally do the remaining puzzles on the island to get a small amount of XP/Currency. This quickly becomes a problem as most creatures/items on the map don't give you anywhere near enough XP/Currency to balance this out. You are encouraged to discard the resources you gather as they all have a value of xp/currency you can recycle them for. Even if you do collect enough items to craft a health potion it will cost you 50 points of the xp/currency to craft instead of being a free crafting system it costs the resources and a fee. This seems like something that can easily be fixed just by adding a secondary currency for the main gameplay progress separate from the player xp/currency so hopefully this is something the developer can look into in the future. The combat in general is not that satisfying and seems more like a after thought rather than something that was fleshed out. Enemies attack patterns are just annoying and you're often interrupted mid combo more often than not resulting in a a very unsatisfying combat system. Normally this would be remedied by blocking or dodging and using something like invincibility frames but this games block feature is locked behind upgrades meaning your only option is the dodge feature which is just a normal dodge with no invincibility frames and normally that would be fine but most creatures have at least one attack that you can't space yourself far enough with the standard dodge. I think in general terms of gameplay there needs to be some QA as the core gameplay outside of the puzzles is just not that enjoyable when it could be fixed really easily by adding invincibility frames to the dodge feature and making the player not stagger so easily then also adding a separate currency/method of progressing the story than the currency used to level up the players stats/upgrades. There were a handful of bugs I experienced during my playtime and reported to the dev that hopefully will be removed before the game is released.   [h1]Graphics[/h1]  The art-style of some of the assets leaves a lot to be desired, as a lot of the character/npc models don't fit the same styling for example during the opening cutscene the main characters model is a more modern anime type character and feels very out of place next to some of the lower quality rock creatures/npcs that opt for a fantasy look that fits the worlds scenery in that specific cutscene but doesn't fit when looking at the rest of the characters in that sequence. Even the other anime characters in game have different styling that the main character which feels really off when they're seen together in the cutscenes. A lot of the enemies the player ends up fighting seem like very cheap/generic character assets with one of the bosses definitely being a purchased asset seen here [url=https://www.unrealengine.com/marketplace/en-US/product/cerberus] Cerberus [/url]. The environments all have their own theme one being a nature theme going for a more natural environment full of trees and green earthy tones with some castle type architectures, another being a desert theme etc... I really liked the style for the nature island even though there are a lot of questionable landscape designs where parts of the environment just sharply drop off in an unnatural way. Most of the other areas are just about what you'd expect, and didn't really interest me as much as the first island. Performance was great and I had no issues maxing out the graphics (minus shadows being one step below max) and maintaining 60fps. While the game ran fine there were some oddities in that some of the early cutscenes were locked at 24fps (cinematic?) and then a bit later into the game all the cutscenes stopped being locked to 24fps which just felt really odd to me. My biggest gripe with the video settings is the lack of a V-sync/framerate cap as the game just had insane screen tearing, even when I did manually lock my framerate. Hopefully that gets added in the near future.   [h1]Sound[/h1]  I was told that during my playtime that audio was still being added in the final quarter of QA so take this section with a grain of salt. The voice acting is all over the place. There are some high quality and recognizable voice actors/actresses but at the same time, there are these really and I mean *really* bad just low quality placeholder recordings for the mobs/creatures especially in the very first cutscene which is just jarring going from one decently voiced character that's has a quality recording to then have this crackling mic low quality voiced creature essentially take you out of the experience. The sound design in general though needs work as everything in these cutscenes felt...empty. There was no ambient sound at all just a slight amount of background music and the voice actors, no environmental sounds such as the foot steps, combat noises, movement of any kind to be honest. The worst thing here though is I don't think whoever did the voice casting gave the actors/actresses any direction which left some of the scenes to play out really awkwardly as none of the characters are giving the same type of energy in the moment. Hopefully this is all worked out soon as it currently just has really awkward pacing in the cutscenes and exploring the world feels empty since the characters footsteps are practically inaudible/nonexistent.   [h1]My Opinion[/h1]  I am very disappointed as I came in with big expectation from seeing the reception of  Light Tracer. The main issue is the way combat/exploration was shoehorned into the game which makes it feel like an afterthought rather than a planned feature with the game shining in its puzzle mechanics. The game can be saved and improved upon if given some though to separate the game progress from the character progress and if the combat is polished. In its current state its hard to recommend though I would highly recommend keeping an on Light Tracer 2 in hopes that they can improve the formula."
"[h1]#tinygamereviews[/h1] Like playing a crappy version of Rock Band, but without any variability in pace, difficulty, or any music at all. I guess it's not really like Rock Band. Or it is.

"Dark Witch 1 is an amazing game, but this remaster definitely leaves a lot to be desired. As the title implies, this is a remake of Dark Witch 1. But there's barely anything added here. Sure, there are some new attacks, which were cool, but the extra stuff in game isn't great. Furthermore, a lot of the stuff from 2 is absent. They added the meter from 2, why not add more? This is a remaster after all. The new graphics also pale in comparison with Hi-GO!'s work. I'd suggest turning off the new graphics, but you can't without reverting all the good balances and changes in game. WTF? Other remasters have this feature, so I don't see why this couldn't be done here. Plus, I was kinda disappointed with the soundtrack changes. They added the Dark Witch 2 and 3 boss music change, but not the full soundtrack? On the plus side, the post game is a little bigger but still disappointing. This port also lags as well, which is odd, as 1 runs perfectly on the PC. Overall, buy the original, it's still available on Steam. This doesn't cut it.  EDIT 1/1/23: Updated due to new changes. First off, the poor performance was on my end (I think). Usually the game froze for a second when starting a stage, but that seems to be gone now, and I don't know why.   Second, there was a new update that adds a screen shake effect once you get hit, without a way to disable it, and it looks awful. Just another reason not to recommend this version. Just play Classic.   Oh yeah, Classic is now 7 bucks, without the new features of Renovation. As lackluster as they may be, that's scummy as hell, and not even my favorite video game series gets a pass from that."
"Cute little game, peaceful at times, stressful at times and nice amount of levels. Endless mode rules.  I have so many ideas for multiplayer modes, bring it on!"
"This VN starts out absolutely terrible. It tries to be funny but predominantly failed for me (and I normally like absurd comedies), plus the story was just idiotic, the writing was terrible, and why all the non-consensual crap?   I saw reviews saying there was actually a decent story to this, though, so with how hard it is to find a good adult VN in a fantasy setting, I stuck with it. And they were right. The plots do get better and some of the characters become a bit more appealing (although Zebia gets stupider for some reason). As long as you don't take it too seriously, the political machinations provide some interesting and entertaining stories.  The artwork is also decent, although the sprites are a bit awkward looking, and there's quite a bit of uncensored H content, although it was pretty repetitive.  So why the thumbs-down? First of all, the price. This is really only worth it with a sizable discount. Secondly, the non-consensual content. They tried to introduce reasons for it to save the ""hero"" image of the main character, such as everyone being drugged or a character not being ""honest with her feelings,"" but he knew in the story that it was still wrong, and let's face it - drugging people to take advantage of them and people telling themselves that ""no doesn't actually mean no"" are concepts that are all too real and should not be normalized or romanticized. I know there are plenty who say this is just a fantasy so people shouldn't get bothered by it, but I find that argument to be ignorant as well as irrelevant, as I still personally found it unpleasant and would have liked some forewarning so I could make the choice to avoid it. However, there was no such warning in the mature content description at the time of this review.  That said, I will probably look into other VNs in this series if they are put on a sizable sale and reviews state that the story is good again, assuming I can get a better idea of the content. Hope you found this review helpful."
"Teamkill is a game with a very similar sense of movement and gun-play that may be simlar to that of Unreal Tournament or Quake 3 Arena. The objective of the main game mode is to convert the enemy players in the game to your team, using what is essentially a railgun, complete with a slow fire rate and deadly accuracy. There is also a ""hide and seek"" mode, where one player is the seeker, armed with the railgun, and must convert the gun-less hiders into his team before the round ends.  Whether playing in two split teams, individual ""teams"", or playing hide and seek, Teamkill offers a unique and novel concept. The combination of solid gun-play and movement keeps the game feeling exciting as you frantically attempt to jump and strafe around your opponents, especially in lobbies with higher player numbers. There is also a taunt button, which is always nice.  The only suggestion I have is to possibly have a lives system for low-player lobbies. This is only on account of rounds sometimes ending extremely quickly in lobbies with 5> players. Otherwise, the game is extremely fun to play, and could offer a relatively high skill floor if people put in the time."
No one would really  buy such things  right? Hahaha [spoiler] well...	[/spoiler]
"If you play powdertoy or played Falling Sand you'll love this, granted its got less elements but that's alright, so far so good looking forward to more updates in the future"
Perfect cliffhanger!
This Game is still in very early development but regardless is a very neatly crafted game. I cant wait for the full game to be released!!!
I came looking for copper and i found gold

"Much better than the original, it lacks a CG gallery and would be amazing."
One of the best recent visual novels I've played. It has surprisingly nice lore for a visual novel and a unique story line. I absolutely loved playing each characters route minus Daniels. I'm assuming his was a last minute decision because it was very shoehorned in and forced. I got whiplash from his ending it came so fast. Which was pretty disappointing as I'd saved his for last expecting it to be more dramatic and emotional. It didn't ruin my opinion of the game even if I ended it on a lack luster note. I still definitely recommend playing!
"I love the idea of driving games combined with horror/mystery elements even though I get scared very easily. The gameplay feels very smooth and the world looks great so I hope the game will get updated with some more locations and plot elements to discover because as of yet, I don't think it's possible to find out what happened to the place.   Also some signs would be nice before corners, I often had to look were the other roads were. I hope there will be a lot more games like these."
very simple game/solf for relax ur eyes  (or destroy :))) . Pick bugget circles and earn points) it looks like a deception of vision (from name - illusion)
Installed this game to play with a friend. We were never able to connect with each other. 10/10 Game of the year.
"For me this is Lunar Flight meets Hardspace: Shipbreaker. Set at the right price point for the content, set at the right amount of difficulty to make it a challenge but not so difficult that you give up, this is a fun space game. Pilot a tug type ship using Newtonian physics to move cargo around in a zero G environment. With the training videos it doesn't take itself too seriously and is just the right amount of cheesiness without being over the top or annoying. A nice gem of a game. Would recommend."
Really excited to see where this goes from here. Keep up the great work!
Me and my classmates were playing this they are all dead and nobody has found there bodys  so overal 10/10 experiance
Gut game.
Server so buggy. Aura gone the 70% of the time. Don't get compensation. Waste of money and time. You are lucky if you didn't spend a single dollar on this garbage.
"I can already tell this game will be a banger. I love the art style in this game with mixing thee 2D and the 3D art style working phenomenally. The controls are nice and smooth, nice music and great voice acting."
nice scenery but the 6 level is broken and cant be finished and the driving is fucking annoying
it has one song and it is in the trailer not worth a dollar
"An expansion for Aeon's End, this DLC adds 2 new bad guys, 1 new mage hero and 7 new supply cards.  Blight Lord: Gives mages cursed gems that do provide aether but also hurt the mage, though the mages can spend aether to get rid of them. Marginally difficult. Wayword One: A creature that moves around the spell field, taking full damage from aligned spells and reduced damage from misaligned spells. A strange battle. Fairly hard. Malastar: This mage has a unique spell that can speed up his charges. His charge ability allows him to grab any spell from the supply you like and prep it to either his breach or an ally's. He also starts with an interesting setup with his spell breaches.  An excellent amount of content if you have 3 dollars burning a hole in your pocket."
"Nice, short point & click mystery. Captivating story. Really enjoyed it!  2 hours for 100%. (All missable, so use a guide.)"
Need a Marine Mania DLC/Expansion Pack with dolphins and shit.
"TLDR:  A mediocre memory game, it's not really what I would call a cooking game, it's all about memorizing ingredient order to survive another another day and get a new highscore. Memorizing sandwich ingredients as fast as you can just doesn't make for a fun game.  Full review: Let's talk about gameplay first, In Make The Burger you... don't make the burger, technically speaking. You just pick toppings, you don''t need to cook meat patties and you don't need to cook various toppings first, you just shove it into a burger by clicking on ingredient icons. Gameplay consists of customers showing up ordering a burger(never more than one and never soda or fries), click on correct ingredients in correct order and you made the burger, then you have to drag and drop it on a customer. If you screw up even a little customers will leave totally unhappy, every order has to be perfect or it's considered a disaster. There are also unlockable ingredients, but these just add more things for you to click on, as I said there is no simulation of cooking involved, you just click on ingredients. There is absolutely no restaurant managing aside from getting more tables. So gameplay is extremely primitive, ""why would anyone wanna buy this?"" the devs thought and decided to make it as difficult as possible, mainly by making it a memory game, you have to memorize orders before stuffing ingredient because you can't see order information while ïn cooking menu. Another way difficulty is achieved is by giving you progressively less and less time to ""cook"" and by flooding you with customers.  On a bright side, this game is pretty, it's charming, bright pixel art is about the only good thing here. The music and sound is just ok for a $2.69, game though it could certainly use more than one(1) music track."
"My friend Keeth highly recommended this game to me and I'm pleased so far, especially considering the price tag. Overall I'd say that's a pretty addicting game with lots of elements from other games combined together to make for a unique experience. Note to developer: if you can please add couch co-op and release it on the Switch!"
COMPLETE. GLOBAL. SATURATION.
"Had higher hopes for this, clunky controls, despite only playing for about an hour I was already bored with the gameplay loop..."
"病毒恶化 VirusCrisis is a unique mix between roguelite cardbattle RPG, survival and classic visual novel games. Let's get a closer look.  [h1] The Story[/h1]  病毒恶化 VirusCrisis doesn't really have a complex backstory, it's more on a simple side. An unknown virus outbreak happened in your city, turning all infected people into hideous creatures.  A small group of people barricaded in a school building, trying to gather survivors and supplies.  Your name is Huang Zili, a good person at heart, but a lazy one in reality. Along with your teacher Wang, you will get 3 random characters, that you can reroll before you start. https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=1974941861  Visual novel elements are tied to 2 things: - individual character routes via dialogues after each day passed. You will get a prompt to talk with someone, you can only choose 1 person. - overall map/story progression So, it's a bit different each time, if you aim to pursue different characters ending. There's also some possible VN-like classic romances, so if that's your thing. Heroines are cute too.  There's a lot of voiceovers also, however, it's entirely in Chinese. Still much better than just a text, i guess. Characters feel more alive that way.  [h1] The Gameplay [/h1]  Divided in 3 parts:  - [b]Visual novel part[/b] (as mentioned above)  - [b]Management part[/b], during this phase you can assign tasks to your survivors: attack zombies, gather food & materials, recruit new survivors and such. https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=1974941838  Be aware that in order to recruit new survivors it's better to build dormitory to increase beds and allow a comfortable living for them. Also you will lose more food each day due to increased population.  - [b]Cardbattle RPG [/b] https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=1974945943 This is a bit of a problem, since CRPG is currently entirely in Chinese.  The game allows you to ""Autobattle"" those encounters with monsters. However, some people mention that if you do a perfect win in manual controls it will be a much better result in the end, which is fair, honestly.  I can't say for sure how much worse autobattles are compared to manual control. It's definitely playable (with autobattle), though.  [h1] The Final Verdict [/h1] 8/10  You can enjoy 病毒恶化VirusCrisis even with a rough english translation.   If you're unsure, you can wait for ""Cardbattle"" part translation and from that point onwards all other typos will not be as important, as battle component translations.   - This review was presented to you by ""Casual Game Reviews"" Steam Curator [url=https://store.steampowered.com/curator/32296668-Casual-Game-Reviews/] Casual Game Reviews Steam Curator page.[/url]"
This is by far the crappiest game I've tried in a long time. This is a tech demo at best. The 90s just called and they want their game back.
"Annoying personality, overrides main subtitles, waste of $5, talks over other characters. Do not buy even on sale. Mistake"
"[h1]Before I played Chicken Duty, I had a small pp, no friends, no gf, depression, and no life. These things havent changed, but the game is pretty good[/h1]"
The map is kinda meh but It's not terrible. It's not as fun as the rest of the pack but still better than some older songs.
就凭“Cries of the Firstborn”这首我眼都不眨一下就买了

"PIGBLUE is a beautifully-illustrated visual novel with an intriguing (and depressing) story. Other reviewers claimed the ending muddled the storyline, but I thought the series of events made sense. It's a tragic story; well-written in my eyes. It shouldn't take too long to complete, although some puzzles (specifically the one you must complete to get the key to room 203) are difficult to figure out. The music, art, and story are magnificent, I recommend you play PIGBLUE if you appreciate that sort of thoughtfulness."

"This game is short and sweet, but good god is it hilarious and worth every second of gameplay!"
"A very entertaining classic story narrated by a charismatic little man that I'd thought to grow tired of. Never grew tired of him, he's fantastic! You will die a lot, very hard to win."
"Its a pretty fun game. Very simple, but enjoyable. Give it a try, its free after all."
"Great game, it feels like you are playing strategy but with an increased amount of adrenaline when you are in the middle of a fight. And the music is from another planet or should I say universe.. I can't wait for the full version."
"The item I needed to unlock the next phase of the game did not trigger what it was supposed to, and then it vanished when I walked through the glowing door, so there was not even a chance to finish the game with the item gone. I replayed it a couple times to try to get to the end, but each time, the event that I need to progress does not trigger despite doing everything I'm supposed to. Don't waste your time with this game, not even for free. It's just buggy trash."
Love is a Bitch  - Two Feet
Nice few hours of gameplay. It has a lot of bugs but for a free to play game i had alot fun! 
"I really love turn based strat games, but this game is an absolute joke. Dont remeber last time I was SO boored while playing  TBS.  Cons: Little to no music in game Rediculously slow gameplay without options to speed up animation Strategy part exists only in terms of what equipment or skill you will buy first (I guess later on what equipment you grind for but got none of that in 4h active gameplay) Some P2W for arena as in shop by gold=real money you can buy better stated equipment  Outdated graphics feels like some 2000 years game. Poor UI  Pros: Game works?"
"Holy shit the jump scares! Fun, but I'm a chicken shit lol. So much monsters!"
"Lovely game, very relaxed and the artwork is pretty good, Not too difficult but challenging all the same. Keep up the good work!"
Very clear instructions for first time players. If you already have game nothing new.
"Its a turret game in essence, however the first game has 50 waves, which I survived and was just getting into the game but it bugged out and it wouldn't load the next phase....."
genuinely a fun game to mess around with
Wonderfully toxic.
Underrated Survival Horror Game
waste of time
As a penguin myself... BIG NO! ANIMAL CRUELTY AGAINST PENGUINS!
"Another great game in the series. If you like the others, you'll like this one as well. As usual, it keeps some things and changes others."
really cool DLC if ya like building tree houses :)
"Wow I have to say this game was way out of my expectations, I love it so much. If you guys plan to make this as a series I will support you all the way."
"Wonderful fresh game! Exploring the world, learning about what people had/wanted, and interacting with the best inventory management system I've seen kept me hooked for the ~10 hours I played before beating it.  I don't usually take notes/draw maps for games but this one really made me want to in a good way.  The platforming is very goofy and surprising: you bounce off walls automatically. You can use that to ricocheting upwards and reach things you couldn't otherwise. However, as often as your aversion to walls is helpful, it can also be something to fight against when you just want to stop moving but your momentum carries you from wall to wall. It's such a neat take on platforming and that's not even dealing with the items like the bouncy shoes that help you get even higher but good luck stopping or getting into a one block high space with them! Then there's the way you throw items out of your inventory, many of which you can ride on and use to bounce in a more controller way. Everything combines into really engaging movement mechanics.  The only negative for me is that this game makes the quick launcher for steam really wide lol."
"Out of the many DLC available for Earth Defense Force (EDF): Iron Rain (IR), this was the only one that really interested me, as it not only includes weapons and other items available for your character, there are 14 missions available to play as well. These new missions serve as the final challenge for those who want to push the difficulty of the game to its height, with enemies swarming in abundance, emphasizing the strongest, most durable foes available. There's some new variations on already existing enemies, such as gold-plated ants and black scorpions, but sadly they didn't develop any completely new insects in this DLC. I did find the rogue AI forces an interesting adversary, though with an invading alien force to contend with, it seems an unnecessary addition to the fray.   There's not much need for this content though, and I'd only suggest it for those who already are playing the base game for dozens of hours to grind for better gear, as they'd be the sort to enjoy this content the most. Plus, the difficulty of these missions can vary considerably, as some weren't any worse than the standard missions from the base game, whilst others were particularly cheap and frustrating. Two of the new enemies use moves that will stun or freeze you in place, which is already an issue, but the way these enemies behave and how many of them there are is the real problem. I didn't complete the last mission due to this issue, as the black scorpions would pursue me faster than I could fly away, with AI mechs firing ice beams at me. Getting stuck in a loop, with no way to recover or fight back is a terrible mechanic to cheapen what could otherwise be a tough but fair fight. I'm sure having better weaponry would help, but it wouldn't overcome getting stun-locked. For me, what makes this even less valuable is comparing it against the mission pack DLC from EDF 4.1, as those were both cheaper than this one, and also offer more missions to play. For me, this DLC is less of a golden storm, and more of a golden shower or shit storm, whichever you prefer."
"My boss found out I was playing this game, now he's playing it too. Fun and challenging, congratulations to the team!"
"Kwaidan ～Azuma manor story～ is a mixed bag of a retro action game, so what’s the story. it was a peaceful night in Japan in 1933 a powerful Hososhi is training his young protege in the art of fighting evil yokai, it was supposed to be simple, but then their training is interrupted when a servant of a local manor barges in and claiming that the manor is under attack by powerful Yokai.   Then the leader of the Yokai appears and a hard battle is fought, but after the battle the leader of the Yokai incapacitates the Hososhi, now it's up to the young protege to venture into the manor and stop the yokai and return her master back to normal or all is lost.  So what is the likes, the story is pretty good at first I thought it was going to be a simple go to a mansion and stop the bad guy story, but it had some pretty nice twists which was a nice surprise. The characters were okay, not really compelling except the father but other than him, the other characters are pretty simple honestly, but that's not a bad thing.   The gameplay was okay it's pretty simple you have three items to deal with certain type of Yokai, a spear for big enemies, an energy blast that can hit grounded enemies and the mirror that can be used to hit enemies that are hard to reach, you can also block by walking backwards using the d-pad. But the gameplay also has point and click elements in it and I found it to be pretty okay, not too hard to control it added an interesting element especially when you get the ability to go to first person mode, although I will say the point and click elements and first person mode does sometimes feel a bit underutilized.  The graphics are very good; it definitely captures the look and feel of an old school PS1 game with its visuals while still being pretty well detailed. The levels were good basically the levels takes place mostly in the manor and its grounds, but I feel like it didn't overstay it's welcome and get repetitive and boring to look at, it also had some nice detail and some interesting backgrounds.  The music is really good with plenty of nice tracks to listen too. The puzzles in the game were okay, not too hard to figure out and if you get stumped you could always look up a walkthrough.The enemies and bosses were pretty good they had some pretty nice designs and if you're familiar with Japanese mythology some of those Yokai you'll know.  So what is the dislikes, the final boss is absolute garbage, it's just completely unbalanced. Basically you're fighting in this cave and the boss goes through these different holes and whatever hole he comes out of that's where you can hit him, seem simple enough.  But the problem is that he summons multiple enemies to come attack you, which is really hard especially since some of those enemies are really annoying to fight which makes the boss fight practically impossible to beat, especially when you don't have any health items.  I also felt like some of the enemies can be really cheap with their attacks, like after you defeat a bunch of enemies in the area and leave that area and come back the enemies respond, that's simple enough but sometimes they respond in different locations which can throw you off and get yourself hurt.  The two achievements the certificate of full proficiency modern mode and the certificate of full proficiency origin mode feel impossible to get, basically you have to beat the game without getting hurt and without saving while playing either in the original tank controls mode and in modern mode as will I find that to be quite impossible, especially when dealing with the final boss. Also the price for the game is way too high, if it was like 10 bucks I would be more okay with it, but it's like $25 it's way too high, especially for a game that you could probably beat in 5 hours at best.  Okay now that I have told you this, Kwaidan ～Azuma manor story～ is a mixed bag of a retro action game, with a pretty good story, okay gameplay and very good graphics. So do I recommend this game it's kind of hard to say if you do want to play the game it has some pretty good merits, but they're also some really annoying parts to it. Ultimately if you do want it I suggest get it when it's on sale and save some money."

"Send one squad to clear the roads send one to scavenge send one to build at camp send one in different zones to scout yea this is my jam love the game. Does have a learning curve that will frustrate a few players i my self took it as a challenge ( scratched my head for a bit trying to get my team to unload vehicle into warehouse side note they wont unload whats not clicked to unload open vehicle inventory and select items you want to transfer) . Vehicles is the key to survive do not use a slow van to clear the packs use a fast one and drift! takes practice but works use the back of the vehicle to take them out if a zed is behind you on the right side make a left and a right if its on the rear left do not drive away from them and then turn around and drive right into them that will kill the vehicle fast. Different survivors have different skills and buffs use those fast ones to break up a large pack of zed and let them chase you back to your vehicle to take out (thin the herd)  speed 10 survivors cant be caught when running away.There is a lot to this game i barely made it to the industrial zone and sank 20 hours playing, remember to put on backpacks walkie talkies and head lamps when you find them and more cloths to increase your resistance and train when you learn how to make training buildings just know the dead will come for you at your camp when its big enough they will notice and you will have to defend from raids. Having a blast with this game i highly recommend.Just a side note where you start is not the only camp you can make, that one is not to good the warehouse is to far from the vehicles that need to be unloaded use the one in the farm lands.have fun i know i will."
Once a planet has 15 missle basses it is almost undefeatable.  Sent 250 ships against a base and was completely wiped out.  Thats just stupid.  Glad it was a free test version.  Will delete and wont buy.
"Wont install, just opens the game.  edit: sorry, it must have downloaded overnight or something because I did indeed already have it installed. Thanks!"
SHUT UP AND TAKE MY MONEY!
"honestly was expecting some minor lore about brigador but what i got instead was one of the best scifi war stories i've heard in a long time. production value is also exellent all round and the voice actor does an amazing job. would reccomend even if you haven't played brigador (though you might want to check it out if you like this, its a perfect introduction)"

"Steam rejected the full release of this wonderful game. BOO! It's really starting to grow on me, this new world of Evenicle. The music's fun. The characters are endearing. The rules of 1 per human aren't the main concern like in the previous, so that's new and Alex is like the Aster but with some level of common sense to at least have morals as a doctor, so I'm liking him. Kindly someone tell me where I can buy the full game with a method that is convenient."
"I love word games and this one, though clever and attractive was very easy to do.  It was addictive and I look forward to completing all 36 steam achievements in due course. My first play through took me 4 hours and I will happily play another 4 to complete the game fully."
"An interesting adventure game that’s filled with Polish history, strange entities and ghosts, but there are a few areas that could be improved upon.  Intro  The Land of Crows is an indie side-scrolling horror adventure game that’s heavily inspired by gothic writer’s of old, such as Edgar Allen Poe and Goete. It was also inspired by classic thriller adventure games of the 90’s, which is why it utilizes an old school art style. When I first discovered the game it immediately reminded me think of games like Downfall or The Cat Lady due to its art style but this is a very different entity in its own right. Do read on to see what I thought of the game.  Story and Setting  The Land of Crows takes place in Poland during the late 1800’s and follows a man named Jan as he investigates his friend Tradeusz’ mysterious murder. Much of the game’s story revolves around talking to other characters that inhabit the small town he’s visiting to learn more about the murder. There’s a ton of Polish history mixed into the book as well, such as Poland’s involvement in Napoleon’s campaign in Russia, and Russia and Austria’s occupation of the country. There was a plethora of history that I wasn’t familiar with and it was quite informative and interesting. I will admit that there were times when the history took over the game a bit too much which began feeling like a history lecture, and it almost put me to sleep a couple times, so it can feel a bit too much at times. Especially when it’s supposed to be a horror adventure game.  The story also deals heavily in the occult because what game based on the likes of H.P. Lovecraft doesn’t. There’s also elements of the supernatural mixed in too with ghosts popping up in the late game. It’s also worth mentioning that some of the characters in the game can be a little unlikeable due to their strong opinions on various things, but I myself didn’t have any issue with the majority of them. Figured I’d mention this fact, just in case.  Personally, my favorite part of this game’s story was actually the ending phases of the game when Jan was traversing another world, which was absolutely bizarre to say the least. Leading up to that point was a bit hit and miss with me. I found the ghost part to be pretty neat too but I found myself falling asleep during the history parts. Thankfully the History really only pops up in the beginning if you make an effort to talk to everyone first. I went through the story in a very roundabout way though so it might not be as bad for those that go in the proper directions.  Gameplay  As mentioned, The Land of Crows is largely an adventure game but one that utilizes a side-scrolling setup. It’s also recommended that you use a controller to play the game because it makes things quite a bit easier. The game doesn’t recognize your mouse, so everything is done with either a controller, or the keyboard.  Much of the game revolves around wandering around the game world to chat with people. There are puzzles for you to solve but they’re quite simple and are mostly item-based puzzles so they’re super easy to figure out. You can also collect most items long before you even need them. Most of the really important items you need to wait until you’ve talked to the right people about though.  One thing I was pretty happy that the game included was the ability to teleport to important locations like the stone circle or the village tavern. You can’t teleport to every area in the game but it does make travelling a little less tiresome because your character doesn’t have the ability to run, and they walk incredibly slowly.  The character also provides commentary on various things within the game world, usually regarding history or tidbits of information. None of it is truly important to the story but it does provide a little more information about the world and its inhabitants.  Gameplay-wise, you won’t find anything unique or out of the ordinary here. If you’re familiar with side-scrolling adventure games, it’s business as usual. It’s also quite linear in design so it’s incredibly difficult to not figure out where to go or what you need.  One other thing I wanted to mention is that the game isn’t normally in black and white. The game features quite a few filters to change how the game looks. The one I used was grayscale since I thought it looked good. There’s also a sepia feature, and 3 old camera filters as well. The default color of the game is an old photograph style yellow. I tried out the old camera filters but they flashed/flickered a lot which wound up making my eyes hurt quite a bit so I ended up shutting them off.  Areas That Could Be Improved Upon  As I was playing through the game, I noticed a few things that I felt could be a little better. The first and foremost was the writing. It’s not terrible by any means but it is quite obvious that English wasn’t the author’s first language and there were a lot of areas that had some fairly odd writing. I’m much more lenient when it comes to stuff like this because English is a difficult language and typos and such usually get ironed out pretty quickly by developers. I wouldn’t let it dissuade you from giving the game a shot as well.  Another area I would love to see improved (But is really only a minor gripe) is the walking speed. I know that speeding it up will shorten the game’s length but it honestly took me close to 9 hours to beat the game, quite a lot more than the mentioned 3-4 hour length. This was also with utilizing the teleporting feature as soon as I unlocked areas. It’s a much longer game than it seems and increasing the walking speed slightly would certainly help get to areas you can’t teleport to much faster.  Verdict  Overall, I enjoyed the game but not as much as I was expecting I would, I will admit. The game’s story wound up being quite interesting but I did kinda feel that it was all over the place and its pacing was a bit muddled because of it. The random elements of history just popping up during the middle of the plot definitely derailed the pacing at times. That said, it’s not a bad thing that they were included, they should have had separate dialogue trees instead of in the middle of an important conversation. It was a pretty decent adventure game though and if you’re a fan of the genre it’s worth a look at least, it’s also only $5.99 so it’s quite cheap as well. I’m going to pause on this one myself, but I still recommend giving it a look, you might enjoy it.  [Be sure to visit SaveorQuit.com for more in-depth reviews!]"
"This is a spectacular platform! It's well paced, colorful and lively, and has decent challenge. I especially like the progression where you'll pick up abilities that help you reach places you previously couldn't. It's a great game for a good price!"
The game is really pleased with the style of graphics. The locations also look good.
"Egg King is overall a game that takes time to understand it's physics. I recommend the game to people who have a lot of spare time and don't know what to do with it. The game helps pass the time quickly in other words. In addition, sometimes when you are alone you might play single-player games and just relax, therefore, Egg King might be the right game to help you relax and chill.  AO Games did a very good job I believe Egg King can be super competitive in terms of speed running and finding the weirdest ways to pass checkpoints in the fastest times possible."
"Another student project from [url=https://store.steampowered.com/search/?publisher=Breda%20University%20of%20Applied%20Sciences][b]Breda University of Applied Sciences[/b][/url], this one transports you into a magical realm of the Norse Gods, stranded on an island after a mysterious storm capsizes your ship and leaves you almost dead on the shores.  With your life slipping away, Odin grants you a blessing, tethers your life to this plane and sends Muninn, one of his loyal ravens, to guide you in escaping and returning to your home. The blessing has a duration and you need to replenish it at shrines dotted around the island that also act as save and respawn points if you die. Storywise, this is a great mechanic as it evokes the feeling of being in another realm and adds some urgency to your escape. Gameplaywise, the blessing runs out far too quickly and you will find yourself thinking about shrines far more than you need to. Depending on your patience, it can become a slight annoyance.  The visuals are splendid, colorful and striking. All the designs, characters, their clothing, shrines, game menus and the entire island breathe Norse mythology. Special applause goes to the designs of the main character and the Norse Gods, they really look spectacular. Soundtrack is nothing special, but adequately paints the overall ambience.  To escape, you will need to explore the island, help the locals, evade the lost souls, identify ingredients, craft a lot of recipes, make runes and trade words with the Gods. ""Puzzles"" take the form of finding ingredients and making recipes that allow you to progress and open alternate routes across the island. All the ingredients are usually nearby, but you will find yourself doing some backtracking. If you die, you lose all the ingredients you were carrying. If you're wondering, no, there's no body for you to pick up and get them back.  Your biggest threats are your draining blessing, exploding mushrooms, lost souls that appear in some places that can quickly drain you if you're not careful, and most of all, cliffs, narrow bridges and the game's pathing. This could've used more work as the character sometimes gets stuck on environment or just slides off a cliff if you approach it wrong. Runes have a couple of uses, but they all feel underwhelming compared to the amount of work and ingredients you need to craft them. There are a few items you can craft or find that are one use and provide special abilites that will help you traverse certain locations.  The game has no mouse support, which is slightly weird. Keybindings are standard, but cannot be rebound and it features controller support. I've also noticed it spins up the GPU a bit more than necessary and stutters a bit, most often when the music suddenly changes. I played on an i7, RTX2070, 32GB RAM and an SSD. Your experience with hiccups may vary.  Developed over a year, from September 2019 until June 2020, this is a stand out little project that wonderfully crafts the world, story and feeling of exploration. It has slight technical problems and some questionable gameplay decisions, but it's well worth a few hours of your time wandering the island of Vanaheim. And it's free.

This game is nasty!
 they should increase the difficulty
"This tool is great for adding animations to games. With the useful presets and examples, it's excellent for game jams and prototyping.  The reason I cannot recommend this software is stability, or the lack thereof.  Empty input in selector? Crash Unparsable input in selector? Crash Hit cancel while an input is blank? Crash  If you don't mind the inconvenience this presents, and you save often, go for it. Otherwise, I cannot recommend this without bug fixes"
"game nice, very good, puzzles arent very hard, the monster looks like freddy from FNAF"
This is a clean and minimalist crossword puzzle.  It's simple to understand the mechanics and the difficulty increases as you make progress in this game in a smooth way.  Highly recommended game.
"An amusing little diversion for only a couple bucks, but the game play kinda sucks . . . I can recall flash games from 10-15 years ago that performed better in terms of controls and gameplay mechanics"
"So the voice acting is great some names of certain characters don't fit at some points. The gameplay is awesome but the mapping system, the input before you launch the game if you don't know, could be simplified a little bit. The characters are charming and everything. I know this is early access so I'm not judging it too bad cause its an Early Access, there's bound to be some issues. Also first boss was easy due to a glitch where it couldn't harm me XD"

The reason I bought this bundle at the hefty price of $25 goes much deeper than getting a sick cosmetic. I haven't enjoyed a FPS this much since Destiny 2 which I just can't invest the time it requires. It truly reminds me of the old days of playing halo on 360. If you buy this consider it an investment into the Devs to help improve this fantastic FREE TO PLAY game.
"This is one of those games that isn't for everyone -- but everyone should try.  A lot of people would call it a walking sim. ""Oh, so it's not a GAME."" Listen. No. It's absolutely a game, but it's not the kind where the goal is to win. It's the kind where the goal is to have an experience shared in a way that is more visceral than non-interactive works. It's structured play in service to a story and a hotbed of complex thoughts and experiences that are difficult to convey unless you are in the shoes of a man who is trying to accomplish a task and also make the difficult choice to push back against a demand the protagonist can no longer find reasonable. It's a story to be played, not simply witnessed.  And Adios is a sublimely executed story, in large part thanks to its moving parts which you are free to mess with and examine and toss around at decent length.  With a runtime of about two hours, you could conceivably knock it out in an afternoon. However, I came back to this one a few times and poked around at all the ways the narrative branches and comes back in on itself, and some moments I revisited simply because... well, they're impeccably done. The stellar voice acting that would have a lot of AAA games sweating certainly helps, but the script and structure carry equal weight.  Adios is a game that pretty much knows exactly what it wants to be, and is not trying to provide you the foremost in entertainment; instead, it is an experience worth having at least once, with the understanding that, yeah, you're here, you're playing inside a story-first game that carries a lot of weight. Let it happen, meet it on its own terms, and play in the space, and you'll find something that hits surprisingly hard if you let it."
I have bought so many in-game stuff in other games only to regret more than half of those.I am happy to say that this is not one of those.
This is my favorite text based game I've played so far.
"Well!.. it's a 3 dollar game..  You get what you paid for.  The controls are clunky at turning, but once you start swimming around the map, it's enjoyable.   Distance of view needs to be increased, I believe that's how they hide the map rendering in."

FIFTY THOUSAND PEOPLE USED TO LIVE HERE  NOW IT'S A GHOST TOWN
"This game was, as far as quality, about what I expected.  The games main game has something to do with looking at the female and judging their looks 1-5.  I went through about 3 rounds of this before getting bored.   The game has some other ""Room"" options where you are in a building of some sort (which does look fairly real) with 1 or 4 female characters.    The main problems with this game are,  1. The only thing you can do is pick up the woman and have them pose in certain ways (maybe 20 poses).  2. The controls are not very friendly , as far as the grabbing, you need to have your hand in the exact right spot to pick up.  And it seems as tho once you pose them in a certain way it becomes almost impossible to pick them up again.    3. The main part of the game has no way of quitting except completely exiting the program.  4. This game comes Censored... kinda.  Sometimes during certain poses the girls clothes clip off of their bodies anyway.  5. What a pain in the @ss it was how to figure out how to uncensor this game.  Turn the game on with your headset already on.  Go into one of the Room levels.  While there, go to your actual keyboard and type the word uncensored.    6. It seems no matter how hard I try and cant center the view with my Oculus Rift S.  Everything is up too high or I'm too short.  I spent about 40 min just trying to center the dang view, with no luck.  I cant recommend this game as there is literally nothing about this game worth checking out.    What do I rate this game? 2/5  Would I recommend this game? No."

Hey, I like the sound of that combo.  [h1]Gameplay[/h1] There are no tutorial illustrations or levels to be seen. Most devs that can't be bothered to offer interactive tutorials at least provide a [i]picture[/i] guide to help players. Thankfully, this is an easy game to pick up.  It's a basic dart game. You toss darts onto a spinning platform, and the idea is to only hit empty spaces.  [h1]Story[/h1] Before the game begins, you must enter a name. I opted for the name that was provided, Alderman. It is unclear what gender the protagonist is from the get-go. This is a common mistake for adult-games that ask for a name. It's generally safe to assume a male gender.  Krystianna isn't fond of Alderman, [i]for reasons unknown.[/i] He wants to extract revenge on her, for uh, [i]reasons.[/i] In this world, magic exists, and it is taught in ""magic schools"". Magic users hide in society, keeping their powers a secret from the general public. From the Soul Bar they discuss their secrets with other wizards, and (I later found out) that the events of this game take place in the Soul Bar. Alderman was hecka bullied in school, and [i]that's[/i] the reason he wants to punish Krystianna, among others.  His idea of ""punishment"" involves the forceful insertation of his [i]phallic[/i] friend into his lady ""friends"". Fair warning.  [h1]Visuals[/h1] The titlescreen is promising, it reminded me of what one would expect in an arcade. I was disappointed by the lack of title menu, however. It was straight to the level-select screen. The interface as a whole is stylish, each button conforming to a sort-of fantasy theme. You can mute/unmute the game with a press of a button, but the lack of user-settings was abysmal. A few buttons (for difficulty setting and language preference) appear to be non-functional. Either they are broken, or intended to be updated. Non-functional buttons shoul [i]not[/i] be present on the screen, or they should at least be greyed-out. CG's can be reviewed from ""Memories"", but they cannot be full-screened and are heavily obstructed by the user-interface. They must also be reviewed in sequence, with text, and cannot be skipped.

"I can not use the awesome old English letters on my profile showcase!!!!!  PLEASE FIX THIS ISSUE IT MAKES YOUR PRODUCT A RIP OFF CAUSE THAT WHY I BOUGHT IT!!!!!  Its has a small amount of good puzzle plotting where you kinda have to think, and the other half of the challenge is the crappy controls and poor choice in colors for the maps. Between those issues and not being able to DISPLAY the ACHIEVEMENTS in your PROFILE SHOWCASE!!!!!    its not worth play for free!!!!!  Please fix this its a JIP at any price! thank you........"
"[h1]Experienced on the Oculus Rift with Touch Controllers[/h1]  You can view my review & gameplay here: https://youtu.be/T-eC7UJ0Z9o  I bought this on sale for $7.49 USD during the Steam Winter Sale 2019. I pulled the trigger because of all the positive reviews. It seemed that this game had something original for the shooter genre and it was not just another wave shooter.   While I do recommend this game, I am a bit disappointed with the overall lack of polish this game has. I experienced several bugs during my short playthrough. The game took me about 3 hours to finish, but that was mostly because of said bugs. It does have full locomotion & snap turning as well as a comfort & teleportation option.  In this game, you possess enemy robots. It's a cool concept, but there's just an overall clunkiness that keeps it from being a great game. You can possess an archer robot, (with an electric arrow if you pull back on the notched arrow long enough), or a machine gun robot, or a robot with a revolver and a magic wand, or a missile-packing robot, or a jousting robot. None of them felt great on their own. The bow & arrow compared to other games is very mediocre in the shot mechanic. The machine gun just feels inaccurate. The mechanic for the missiles where you raise and lower your motion controllers like you're pulling on a string just feels gimmicky and not a good mechanic to use to boot.   While I do like the level designs for the most part, it also reuses several assets from prior levels. It makes progressing through the game just feel empty. While there is a narrated story here, it is completely forgettable. The voice overs are pretty bad.   The worst part of this game was definitely the last boss fight. Not because it's a bad boss fight (in fact, I thought it was a pretty inventive one). It was bad because of all the bugs I experienced. For whatever reason, enemy trash spawns stop intermittently throughout the fight. If they stop, you can't beat the boss. Unfortunately, I didn't realize this and ended up fighting the boss for a good 15-25 minutes until I finally gave up and decided to restart. I finally realized that you need the trash spawns, but they would stop spawning on several attempts. I also fell through the gameworld on a very good run where I almost had the boss beat.   Per the achievements, only 3% of players have beaten the game on normal. That's not a good sign for such a short game. I don't know if players got bored before the end or if they ran into the errors that I did.   [b]Rate 6.5/10. I wanted to like the game more, but the overall lack of polish and the bugs really brought the experience down for me. [/b]"
"[code]For other game reviews, please [url=https://store.steampowered.com/curator/40640212/]follow us at What The Game?[/url][/code]  TerraNova: Escape Room is a first-person puzzle solving game with an eye towards emulating an escape room. The game is set in a police station of some kind, beginning with an interrogation room. As various puzzles in each area are solved, they unlock keys to getting into the next area. The puzzles are things like a slide picture puzzle where square pieces are manipulated to complete a picture or finding a combination to enter into a code lock keypad. The puzzles start out reasonably difficult for an average player, and progress to very difficult, very quickly.   TerraNova has the standard FPS controls and all of the controls can be remapped to any key, including the keypad. There are graphics and sound options, although for sound the options may have been over engineered. For example, there is music volume and ""ambiance"" volume. Music volume doesn't do anything, it doesn't matter how it is set, the background music stays the same. Ambiance volume controls the actual loudness of the music. The music itself is a short loop which becomes irritating to listen to. The graphics are fairly well done, and most computers can probably turn up the settings, as the overall environment is not overly complex or detailed. Several languages are supported, but there are no difficulty options, and that is a sore point.  TerraNova is pretty cut-throat difficult. The player can easily get to a point where the puzzle to solve is not obvious, let alone gathering clues. Some of the slide puzzles are difficult to solve without numbers associated with the slide pieces. Of course, the player can cut some paper and do this manually, but some sort of difficulty levels and/or hint system is really needed. Most of the time, like an escape room, the player needs to make careful observations of the area to figure out that some things they see are clues, even if they seem trivial  There is some semblance of a back story to TerraNova, but it is totally unimportant to the game. TerraNova is an escape room game with a Los Angeles police station theme. Many of the items placed in the game feel authentic, security and interview cameras, lie detector machine, some pictures on the walls, etc. Many items feel out of place, like a Rubik's Cube, doors where a golden coin and Chinese coin are needed to open, a live statue of a bull-man with a battle axe, etc. Although some of the puzzles can be brute forced, some will require making observations that may seem far-fetched, to be charitable. [b]The bottom line is that TerraNova is a well-made, but difficult to solve puzzle game, it's recommended for those with the patience for a no-hint game. [/b]"
"Covid Kawaii is quite a worth it game. It has outstanding and cutesy visuals which i love. It has amazing gameplay that will suit everybody's needs and it's such an awesome game representing the famous covid. It's also not like other games which gives it, it's unique capabilities. Cannot wait for the game to grow and expand as the upcoming years have been hard. Well enjoy the game and buy it if haven't already. It's worth your monies."
"Again, there is no full screen, but this time you can't expend it, the screen remain small after maximize, same as ConflictCraft, can't find the different, still looks like a flash game.

best game i ever played in my life
Catch The Head is a very bizzare game but in a good way. At its core is a 3d platformer but the devs tried to implement elements from adventures and some old school techniques with different cameras. The whole game breathes nostalgia from the 90's era. The graphics are inconsistent but that didnt bother me as that clearly wasnt the dev's main focus. Gameplay wise as others have said the ranger class is a little clunky with a gamepad but i got used to it. Voice actors did a good job though some were mediocre at best as it happens in low budget games. The music though shines and its by far the best quality of the game. Overall it will give you a good 8-10 hours gameplay in normal mode and then you can purchase skins and various stuff with in-game currency if you play again.  Graphics: 6/10 Gameplay: 7/10 Music: 9/10 Story: 7/10
"Only took 24 hours to beat and get every upgrade but it was fun and i enjoyed it, didnt have frame issue or anything. Would play more if their was more to it but i finished it and moving on, thanks for the game. Only thing i didnt enjoy was the money drop coins stealing my bonus from jackpot over time and my clicking to add value would reset everytime i did a coin drop so i never used it and suggest never using it, went from a 1000 bonus to 45 and had to wait for it to build up all over again, so the coin drop is pointless at this time."
"It can be a bit frustrating sometimes, but once you get the hang of it, clearing a stage gets really satisfying."
"Just run, that is all"
was quiet impressed by this indie solo dev game.  would reccomend
:steamthumbsup:
"I really enjoyed this, received it to stream, ended up loving it."
Amazing game and super fun to play with friends
This game is similar to those arcade games that were on dendy. It's worth trying to play and remember the past and the style of the game pushes it.
"its a good one! in VR during the Night its pretty hard to read the labels white on white. But the Plane makes hell a lot of fun! Together with channels its a awesome Combination, I had a few fights with friends and vs the NPC on the ground."
"Well it's mostly very good. But whatever guitar it switches to for the chorus is just awful, and kinda ruins the experience.  That aside, it's great.  Any chance of a fix?"
"So this amazing NES title has FINALLY been re-released worldwide. I want to talk about this game in general and why you should pick this game up. First a little history (and my feelings about it): this game was a late release for the NES/ Famicom in 1992 (the system ended in 1994) but only in Japan and Scandinavia and not the rest of the PAL territories (...Why?...). It was part of a trilogy of SUNSOFT games that I call ""The Cutesy 3 that never came to North America,"" the other two games being ""Ufouria: The Saga"" on the NES and ""Trip World"" on the Game Boy (These two did make it to the majority of PAL territories). From what I heard, Nintendo of America rejected these titles because ""they were too cute for us Tough North Americans"" and never saw any releases here until one of them (Ufouria) came out on the Wii Virtual Console. There is more to this story but I want to focus on how I knew about this game and how I got to play it before this offical release. One day I was watching someone on YouTube (not going to mention his name because I don't want any trouble from anybody) who made a video on this game and got a reproduction cart of the cancelled but completed North American version that was going to be released. He mention the website (again, not mentioning that site's name and since then the item had been discontinued last time I went on the site) in his video and I decided to snag a copy when I did. Now for my opinions of this game:  The game has a Kirby look-alike with Lime Green skin, horn on top of his head, big cute anime eyes and shoots a star that is created on top of his head. The story is real simple: a girl got this doll called ""Gimmick"" (or Mr. Gimmick, I don't care, but I will call him that since that is what I heard first before finding out his Japanese name) and the other toys are jealous so they kidnap the girl and Mr. Gimmick has to rescue her. So you think that this is just going to be a simple NES platformer in the likes of Kirby or Mario. No. Instead, it's an ADVANCED PHYSICS FOR THE NES based platformer meaning that you will rely on careful jumping and use of your star. It also has a life system where each stage has only 2 life spheres that can be increased to 4, but when you are done with a stage, it will reset to 2. Even though the game has infinite continues, it comes with a heavy consequence. There are secret items that not only increase your score for extra lives, but will also let you access the final level in the game and get the true ending.   There are is a complaint I have with the game in general and that is when you select and use items in the game. To select a item, you have to press down on the D-Pad and to use the item you have to hold up and press the Action (or Star) button. I find this to be strange as there is a select button (on the NES original anyway) and obviously it uses the same control scheme in this rerelease.  I want to say this to new players. Play this game on Normal mode to get used to where things are at and what to do before you tackle the Serious mode because this is not a simple walk in the park.  With all of that said, please, PLEASE get this game. It's one of the best NES/Famicom games that we (North Americans) never got and both the Famicom and NES versions are insanely expensive and rare. I want to see some of these super rare, expensive and sought after games like the ones mentioned earlier in this review (along with some of the late release NES Taito games like Little Samson and Panic Restaurant) to be rereleased so that people don't have to spend there life savings for a game that they may or may not like.  Update:  I had to make a correction that it was SUNSOFT of America that made the decision of not bringing the titles to North America, NOT Nintendo of America. Sorry for the mix-up."
"I want to write a review about the game HUNTERS FOR YOUR BRAIN. This is a top-down zombie shooter. Games will go on any computer and this is clearly a plus. In principle, not a bad game is enough, for example, to relax in it after work. I advise you to purchase."
"is not bad is not good. i dont like games like this but i think  this can work if you are a youtuber or a twitcher. it's very embryonic 2 or 3 things should be added, but I think it may have its niche  "
"I liked the idea: you bought beer, blood, wine, chicken and so on, put them together like blood + beer and then sold it to vampira who has eating in your restourant. They like blood foods, drinks and so on. But they hate garlics soap or garlic foods.. Another customer like garlic food, but hate blood food and so on. There is several type customers: lizards, vampires, humans, demons and so on. Everyone has their vaforite food and drinks, and they have also food and drink what they hate.  I liked to idea.  But there is some problems: you can bought food once per day. Selller is not sell everyday everything. One day you can buy winw, one day not, one day you can buy blood, another not. That why its bit difficult game.."
Great Rock Paper Scissors game. Me and Esmlir Maedi played one game and i won 100-0. EZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZ Buy if you want fun

[b]gravity mode[/b] was another addition, where points are only awarded for blocks destroyed by gravity change, which happens after every 10 blocks. it's really tough.  [b]quests[/b] were another fun post-release addition, like do x of this, do x of that, reach a certain amount of points, etc. there are two regular ones active at a time, completed ones get replaced after the game is over, and there's a third, more difficult one that serves as a daily challenge and it's the same for everybody. xp is rewarded for completing quests, which is used to increase your rank that can be shown off on the leaderboards, next to your name. unfortunately, non-daily quests can't be skipped or re-rolled, but ranks are only for show, so it's not a big deal.  [b]controls are fine.[/b] both the arrows and wasd work for moving left, right and increasing falling speed, you can press 1-5 to use basic and crafted power-ups, and the keyboard can be used in the menus too. power-ups can also be activated by clicking, not sure why that'd be of any help, but more options never hurt. gamepads are also supported.  separate volume settings, resolution options and windowed mode, colorblind options are available, achievements and leaderboards show up in-game, not lazily via the steam overlay, there's even a stats screen with all sorts of information (time played, highest level, destroyed blocks, etc.), plus [b]replays[/b]. each game is recorded and you can share them with your high score on the leaderboards (or in my case just watch other people and feel bad about my lack of skills).  it's a [b]hectic, immensely enjoyable game with good graphics and even better music[/b], highly recommended if you enjoy tetris and its variants. the price is budget-friendly as well and there are limited-time events every now and then for even more variety. make sure to grab the free retro minigame dlc too."
Very cool 80s/90s anime game. Looking forward for Season 2
Very very short and levels are very simple and the game is able to be completed in about 10 minutes
I have more fun in this than actual MMOs
"This sound soundtrack is nice and simple, its an important part of Suzerain, thanks"
"追加札克的发光！科幻紧身衣（金）服装，这个DLC包含在DOA6 ""Nova"" Sci-Fi Body Suit Set和DOA6 Season Pass 4里，买了大包的话无需重复购买。 "
"Nakornsampan is a cute little city build x merge 3 game. If you like mini strategy and puzzle merge games then this would be a good game for you. You build a little civilization by placing the randomly generated tiles in different places and by placing three or more of the same tile together, they merge to create something better. The game ends when you have no more room left on the given map. It is super fun and definitely continuously playable. Although the graphics are kind of small, they are still cute and the music is super relaxing. You can change the background and screen visuals which is a cool and fun addition and this also allows you to increase the map size. Definitely worth the price and it's a fun little mini game to pass the time."
"Awful game worst demo I've ever seen,   No action and an unsolvable puzzle.... great i fired one shot at a guy who was dying!  "
I will do a review now that I finished the DLC  I view this really as one big tutorial.  You are building up your core force for the future DLC's.  This is a prelude to AO 1939 and beyond.  The advantages and disadvantages you pick are very important.  I know some will not play with auxiliary force but but it is implied to be a great pick for SCW.  You can have the Spanish do nothing and use the Italian Infantry.  The big downside is you start the 1939 AO with no experienced infantry except the Azul Spanish unit you get.  Spotting works differently from Panzer Corps.  They way the AI spots.  Understanding this will help.  Building up your artillery and tank force is most important.  Denied Artillery is a common disadvantage pick that I do as well.  So you have to find caches or captures to have enough to build up a decent artillery core.  I restarted without picking Denied Artillery and think it might be the better option  The AI is not very good as they were in Panzer corps but they are numerous.  I would recommend this game.
"These games are my go-to games to relax with before I go to sleep. I had finished all the free ones included in the pack a while ago and I was super excited when lately they added quite a few more games to it. Apart from the puzzles, I've also enjoyed the stories and the characters. I think it's a must-have in your library if you love puzzle games, it's free after all. And I know that you can only unlock two chapters every few hours but that has been more than enough for me personally and in the end hey, if those people got you so hooked on their game, maybe they're worth your money after all."
"Have you been enjoying the recent potion shop game spree?  Then check out Tiny Witch, which released only a few days ago. It's fast-paced and requires a little thinking to win.  Tiny Witch is a fast-paced potion shop game that focuses on the crafting and customer service. The customers get cranky and attack you if you're too slow, so you have to think fast and be efficient.

"Played this from start to beginning in one sitting:  - 80 levels - Easy to beat - Every level from level 25-30 until 80 is the exact same.  If you want to have a mindless game, play this but be aware you'll find yourself in rinse and repeat after a while."
"EDIT: (After Playing Campaign and Horde Mode) The game looks really cool. I like the story Campaign and how it progresses. Art work is much better now. The gameplay is also smooth and fun. I really like the different types of weapons and it was fun to use them on the battlefield. overall i enjoyed the game.  ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Early Access Review: The game is really fun to play. The maps are cool and visually its good. i manage to play single player and some match online too. Yes the game is little buggy right now but hey! its a early access. hope the bugs will be sorted out soon. Friendly developers, quick answer and help got on discord channel. Playing RTS with the Trains, mining and blowing up the other trains, loved the idea. Waiting for next update."
"Game developer is improving the game. The game has significantly improved over the last week. It's still quite janky, but on the way to being something you could play for 15 to 30 minutes from time to time. I was asked by the dev to send screenshots of things that do not work properly and most of them have been fixed within a day.  For being a one man project and almost being removed from Steam by the dev, it's nice to see he found some motivation to again work on his project.   2560X1440, 144Hz is now supported, game runs at around 120 FPS on Proton GE.   A few community comments and E-Mails more and we might get a working game. It's playable as of now, but might not be up to your standards.   OLD REVIEW: If you haven't noticed from the trailer, this game is trash, and I'm here to tell you everything wrong with it. Graphhics options consist of ""Graphics quality"" (Maximum resolution you can set is 1680x1050) and an option ""Ultra Graphics"". Whatever their definition of ultra is, sure doesn't look astonishing by any means.  Game title says ""Psihanul"", in the trailer it says ""Illuminati"" and the buy option says ""Hephaestus"", not very consistent with the game title.  The loading screen seems ripped straight out of Fallout 3 / New Vegas, but at least they changed the color to pink. The controls are sluggish, lighting is bad (dark corners you can't see anything in) and I'm pretty sure they use copyrighted music - if it decides to start playing that is. Ontop of that, for whatever reason they decided Dubstep and ACDC were good choices. I'm not sure what's worse, the controls or listening to ACDC.   There's absolutely no sound besides said music, enemies sometimes do T-posing. Guns have no real recoil, nor any proper reload animation. Slides on pistols have no blowback, rifles no moving receiver (Guessing that hasn't changed from the trailer). The point system shows NUMBER/ - but no goal behind the / you should achieve. It does so at least in the first room you start in. In the second room it shows a goal of 4000 points.  Game freezes as soon as I try picking up the pistol in the second room. I'm guessing that's it and you won't ever get any further than that. Multiple attempts, same result.  Shitty games can be hilarious, but this is just sad - and in no way worth your money. Devs announced the wanted to remove it from the Steam store, but cancelled the removal - claiming they will fix it within a week. Will review it if said updates takes place soon."
Short & Sweet
Great Banished like game with some good upgrades. Still has to be fine tuned tho. Nonetheless great fun
"One of the hardest games i have ever played but that is also because i suck at these types of games, but i absolutely love this game!!! you get to play as a sloth! that's all you need to know. you are a sloth. if you like sloths, buy this game period."
Add controller compatibility so some of my friends that insist on controllers will play.  Otherwise best game on Steam.
"I really enjoy this game for it's simplicity, wish the servers were more active but that's a community issue not developer's."
"I've been playing this game since the first Alpha and I've got to say this is one of the best set of devs I've ever gotten to interact with. The work they put in and the changes you see as a direct result of the community is outstanding. This game has come a long way since the start and I would have recommended it way back then too.   You can have up to 10 people at a time in your world which is really nice if you have more than 3 friends and want to play games together. It's all procedurally generated so no world's the same, but they are all stunning.  The art is absolutely beautiful. The design of the giants and enemies feels unique and if you weren't getting curb-stomped by them you'd want to take more time to look at them.   There are obviously some bugs and issues, it's in beta for Jotunns sake, but they're minimal in their impact of the overall game.  The biggest thing for me was when players disconnect they still occupy a spot in the world so others cant join, but it's already been put in the devs list for next time.   15/10 will recommend to everyone"
 At first it doesn't look like much but turns out to be a fun little game. 
very dumpster much bear
"About Bone Voyage: Bone Voyage is a third person adventure game inspired by old classic adventure games with a modern twist. As a skeleton, you detach your bones and explore a Vessel to the Afterlife after being fished up by the mysterious Captain. Progressing through the game, you will meet more characters, explore more rooms and detach more bones to slowly uncover the story of the mystical vessel!"
3 hours killing Pillars in this game. What is the goal here ? I've never seen such a bad game before
"I would love to recommend this game, as the mechanics and premise are interesting. Climb a mountain! Except this time in QWOP form. Well, it's clear after playing it for a while that some mechanics seem designed to pointlessly annoy you, and the rogue nature is honestly baffling for a game this cheaply designed. Not cheap as in the developer is trying to scam anyone or it's filled with bugs or anything, I mean it feels like the stamina and jumping system feel intentionally ridiculously punishing so as to make players fail more often.   The mountain/cloud and water/rain levels are where the cheapness really feels blatant. The clouds blocking your view are truly nonsensical. How on earth would it be fun or interesting to wait literally 5-10 seconds for them to pass? If you don't wait, which you may opt not to since your stamina goes down still I believe, you're left doing circles with your character, trying to find a ledge completely blind. It was made so much worse when I had to JUMP while the clouds where blocking the view of either me or the ledge I wanted to grab. The jump mechanics are already really poor, as you need to charge it up and release it at the right time even though getting the arrow to highlight the ledge you want is a needless hassle. You may very well end up not even having enough stamina to do a necessary jump, and if that's the case, you literally can't do anything, may as well start over. Even worse, for some reason, your character can't grab onto anything on their way down, so if you mess up your jump, which is very likely, you lose or you're dead. This all gets taken to ridiculous lengths in the rain level. I'm already slipping, AND I need to aim this wonky arrow and time this unintuitive charge up? Once I died on the last (I would guess anyway) rain level that FOR SOME REASON EVEN HAS CLOUDS I was done.   Super cool concept, fun in the beginning, but this would have been better without the rogue elements. That would at least make the cheap failures feel better, since you don't need to start the whole game over if you didn't grapple. The grapple points not bringing you back to the grapple point itself after you fail is also a strangely punishing design choice. If this was made in the spirit of Getting Over It or Jump King, with one giant mountain to climb, and you could lose massive progress fast, I think that would be a lot more enjoyable, and feel more akin to climbing a big mountain.   Totally your vision for the game though, I don't want to sound like more of a dick than I already have so far. Happy others were able to enjoy it, but those were my gripes with the game and why I can't recommend it."
"I'm having a lot of fun collecting, crafting, and exploring in this game. I'm also a fan of the artwork and the chill music."
"This pack's kept very simple which means the pack doesn't include pics with higher resolution. You can unlock all achievements in about 1-2hrs. If you're a hunter then buy it, otherwise think about if it's worth for you"
puzzles and visuals were really better than I thought
This pack causes me great amounts of confusion. Do i have to buy this pack to unlock the characters or are they already included in the other passes. I have both the super and extra pass so im wondering if i just wasted my hard earned 15 bones or if im just retard. comment if u have the answer pls.
"*Contains spoilers*       Let me start by saying I LOVE the House of 1000 Doors series. Nothing can ever beat the first one, but the second and third were excellent as well. Now to talk about the fourth. While the characters had a huge ramp up with their graphics and design, the rest of the game was a crash and burn failure, totally not up to par with the first three. Not only was the game enormously bugged with glitches in almost every other scene, the cut scenes were terrible quality, you just had to cringe your way through it. I will admit it was an interesting premise to test yourself against the other members of the house, but I really enjoyed all the characters as ""good guys"" and was not thrilled with having to fight them. Also, after the bonus game in Serpent's Flame, I was expecting the fourth game to be about Kate learning about her ancestry with the people of light, maybe even a little romance with Rafael, not some teenage nobody as the main character. Overall, I was extremely disappointed with this game, especially the glitches which nearly made gameplay impossible, but if you haven't played the first three in the series, absolutely do so, they are incredible!"
Suprisingly nice and relaxing game!
Didnt give me the kit?
how to chanfe animl
cons: it gets little boring
The Jupiter MKII is a fucking beast.
Its a sweet little game. You can grow/collect/buy items and sell it. The artstyle is very sweet. I realy like it.  Best things:  1) The devs answer very quick and improve the game asap.  2) The price of the game is realy low if you think about all the work it takes to make such a game.  Gabb the games as long as you can get it so cheap! :)
"this game is really cool, found it randomly one night looking to sate my dungeon crawling desires and it has done its job!  9th dawn III kind of reminds me of runescape in a way where you level up skills by simply using them! if you want to make big bubbly potions, catch huge fish and epic monsters, make shiny weapons and armor - all you gotta do is practice. this does make the gameplay a bit grindy, but i think it's enjoyable. the world map and dungeons are pretty huge, so there's lots to explore and do. there's a variety of classes, skill trees and so many monsters to collect.  i would recommend this to anybody who enjoys games that are quick to pick up and get into. the story is vague, but if you're addicted to dungeon crawling like me you're probably not here for a long winded tale anyways."
"Amazing game! :) It's really soft and cute. Also the characters are very silly. My one complain is that the game is very short, I completed it in around 1 hour and a half."
WTF unplayble interface
"It's hard to say whether I recommend people to play this game or not. At the price point it's honestly hard to beat, but ultimately I think I don't recommend it though unless you're desperately in the mood for a foddy-like game.  I've got a decent bit of experience with games in this category, to the point of speed running them for fun since I enjoy them so much.  My first time through Getting Over It took 2 hours on stream. My first time through Jump King took me 6 hours on stream.  Pain took me 13 hours off stream where I could actually focus.  Mechanically the game is very sound, you pull in one direction and your ball flies opposite of that and sticks to walls that aren't ice. It's very simple mechanically and and easy to understand, plus the art style is great. The only mechanical part that's hard to grasp is the roll, which seems to be so precise and finicky that it feels like it's not worth doing half the time unless it's to recover from a fall to the start.  However there's something in Pain that's slightly rare for these styles of games, and that's the number of punishing falls that lead directly to more punishing falls in a row. The start and end sections of the game are actually very forgiving, you can make a fall and end up back near the start of the zone and the jumps to get back up aren't too bad.  The midsection of the game however is not so pleasant. Most sections in the middle have a fall that will drop you back to a zone start, where the jump to make it will immediately drop you back to the prior zone start. If it's not that it'll be a jump that sends you back to the start of the game.   There were countless times when going through the game that I would be like ""Damn! I made it through that finally!"" only to be met with a brand new mechanic that I didn't quite understand at a glance, fail the jump, and end back up two sections back on the very first attempt. It is 'very' punishing in the middle, but not in a fun way like Getting Over It or Jump King provide.  I wish I could review this game more positively and say I had fun with it like I do the majority of other games in this style, but in the end...  It's just Pain."
"This game might [keyword, might!] have been something that's fine on it's own, but it's just dogshit as a sequel. It doesn't really follow up on anything from the last game? Why does it say Kinistra and Phil are around when they literally play next to no role in this game."
"[h1]Before I played Refraction, I had a small pp, no friends, no gf, depression, and no life. These things havent changed, but the game is pretty good[/h1]"
you need other things to play it
"A nice jigsaw game, the koans are very interesting. There are secret itens that can be unlocked in the garden."
"评测更新：猎源进行了一次重大更新，人物形象做了改变，原来让人难以理解和利用的元素系统改为了升级选择成长方向的新模式，玩了一下发现比以前舒服很多，在你拿到一个类型的增强后，后续刷出同类型和联动型增强的概率会提升，这样可以让你每局都能完成一条完整成长路，打出想玩的套路，游戏体验大幅提升。原来的局外加点也从武器上的特定提升改成生命、金钱等综合性的提升，明显提高了资源利用率。这次更新说明制作组在听取玩家意见并积极完善，对肉鸽游戏的理解也更到位了，值得支持。  猎源是一款国产roguelite横板动作游戏，拥有丰富的武器、消耗品、宝物和成长系统，但能明显看到很多前辈的影子，几乎没有什么独创的设定，游戏整体耐玩性不足，需要等待后续更新完善。  游戏的玩法并不复杂，在地图上选择想要进入的下一个房间一路向右前进（在地图上能看到房间有怪物、宝物、商店、赌博等），直到最右方的boss房，打赢进入下一关。在房间里是传统的横板战斗，但同一个构造的房间其怪物的分布也是一样的，并没有很强的roguelite感觉。 猎源有着中西合璧的独特美术风格，整体色调阴暗，场景处处透露着破败的感觉，四处可见中国元素，但主角又是西式造型，还能见到机器人和仪器设备，难道这是赛博朋克1077？  游戏的武器种类丰富，有双刀、大剑、巨斧、弓、太刀、飞镖、盾刀七种，各有独特的机制和技能，配合对应的元素系统，玩法和游戏体验迥然不同。每通关一个房间，可以在6种元素中进行一次三选一，有一定运气因素，因为不一定能刷出你想要的元素。元素可以增加主角的特定属性，激活某些武器的被动效果，同种元素达到一定数量还能解锁新效果，但实际感觉效果并不明显，元素效果也缺乏量化的显示，玩家在游戏初期对其缺乏概念，只能随便选。 猎源的消耗品是一大亮点，游戏英文名叫seed hunter，它的消耗品也全是各类植物，除了草药柠檬这些补血药品和提高属性的石头以外，还可以获得各种帮助战斗的布置性植物，根据效果可以称其为地刺、豌豆射手、食人花、迷惑菇（生命之树其实应该算为药品），是不是很熟悉？我们可以理解为这是制作者对植物大战僵尸的一次致敬。  还有各类宝物，这也是roguelite的核心要素了，随机且强大的宝物都为各个roguelite游戏带来了丰富的可玩性和刺激感，但不得不说猎源在这方面做的并不好。首先，它的宝物需要通过战斗中获取的记忆结晶来逐个解锁（还不一定有命带回来），不解锁的话就只能见到廖廖几种宝物，游戏体验单一；其次，宝物获取途径太少，基本上一个大关只能拿到一件（为了拿宝物也会限制行动路线），存在感太低；最后，宝物的效果过于限定为部分武器和选择的元素，通用性差，说通俗点就是捡了也白捡。  说下roguelite游戏很重要的死亡惩罚，游戏中可以获取灵魂来提升武器和主角的部分属性，死亡会清空携带的灵魂，可以中途通过机器人带回以防止损失。每个成长项目需要120个灵魂，感觉是借鉴了死亡细胞的成长系统。另外，带回的记忆结晶可以拿来解锁宝物；金币可以在赌博房里存起来供以后的局使用；种子可以拿来种植，在玩家穿过一定数量的房间后成熟，收取植物来作为下一次闯关的盘缠。对于这些成长系统，我只能用一个字来评价：肝。开荒时候游戏难度大，得打上好几局才能解锁一个武器的成长效果，然后为了更好地通关游戏，你又不得不每把都选择这把武器来进行，前面也说到了，因为游戏的武器和元素、宝物都是关联效果，武器一旦被限制死，那后续随机出的元素、宝物都可能变得毫无价值，我也完全体会不出roguelite大量随机性带来的刺激感和爽快感。  优秀的roguelite游戏应该是提高随机性和道具丰富度，只要玩家技术好或者脸好就能轻松通关，能把运气不好很快死掉的局的挫败感抵消，还很乐意再开一把；而失败的roguelite游戏则是靠增加游戏难度和肝度来强行延长游戏时间。玩家需要的是一把接一把的爽快roguelite体验而非黑魂式的折磨。  建议直接取消宝物解锁、提高通用宝物占比（比方说降低商店售价、降低地形伤害、提高耐力回复速度、直接提升属性、提高闪避次数等等等等），增加宝物的获取途径（可以给宝物分级，完全可以让打小怪都可以掉落较初级的宝物，最后底下一排宝物看着过瘾），降低武器升级的解锁难度，死亡直接带回全部战利品（参照失落城堡）。  总结：猎源美术风格独特、各项roguelite要素齐全、手感尚佳，但因武器和宝物解锁慢、获取途径少、效果互相绑定等原因，实际游玩难以体会到roguelite游戏丰富随机性和多样性带来的快感，游戏体验单一，没有死亡后继续开下一把的动力。游戏急需更多内容上的更新，国产游戏在这方面的尝试值得鼓励，期待游戏的进一步完善。  “Seed Hunter” is a roguelite 2D action game, with rich weapons, consumables, treasures and growth system, it’s clear to see the shadow of many seniors, almost no original settings, the game overall lack of playability, need to wait for further updates.  The gameplay is not complicated. Select the next room you want to enter on the map and go to the right (you can see monsters, treasures, shops, gambling game, etc. on the map) until the  boss room. In the room is a traditional battle, and the same structure of the room has the same distribution of monsters, and there is no strong roguelite feeling.  It has a unique art style with Eastern and Western styles. The overall color is dark, the scene reveals the feeling of dilapidation everywhere, the Chinese elements are everywhere, but the protagonist is Western-style, and you can see robots and instruments. Is this cyberpunk 1077? ?  There are a variety of weapons in the game. It has dual blade, big swords, giant axes, bows, swords, darts and shields. Each has its own unique mechanism and skills. With the corresponding element system, the gameplay are very different. Every time you clean a room, you can choose one from six elements. There are certain luck factors, because you don't necessarily want to brush out the elements you want. Elements can increase the specific properties of the protagonist, activate the passive effects of certain weapons, and achieve a certain amount of the same kind of elements to unlock new effects, but the actual feeling effect is not obvious, the element effect also lacks quantitative display, in the early stage player is lack of awareness.  The consumables is a highlight. Its consumables are all kinds of plants. In addition to the herbal medicines such as herbal lemons and stones that improve the attributes, you can also get various arrangements to help fight. According to the effect can be called ground thorns, pea shooters, piranhas, confusing mushrooms (the tree of life should be counted as medicine), is it familiar? We can understand that this is a tribute to the Plants vs. Zombies.  There are also various kinds of treasures, which are also the core elements of roguelite. Random and powerful treasures bring a lot of playability and excitement to each roguelite game, but it must be said that Its do not do well in this regard. First of all, its treasure needs to be unlocked one by one through the memory crystallization obtained in the battle. If you don't unlock it, you can only see a little treasures. Secondly, the way to get treasures is too less, basically one level, one treasure (in order to take treasures will also limit the action); in the end, the effect of treasures is too limited to some weapons and elements of choice.  The roguelite game has a very important part called death award, player can acquire the souls to enhance the weapons and the protagonist's partial attributes, death will empty the soul, can be brought back through the robot to prevent losses in a round. Each growth project requires 120 souls, and it feels like drawing on the system of Dead Cells. In addition, the memory crystals brought back can be used to unlock treasures; gold coins can be stored in the gambling room for later use; seeds can be used for planting, after the player passes through a certain number of rooms, and the plants are collected for the next time. For these systems, I can only use one phrase to evaluate: using too much time. When the land reclamation is difficult, the game has to be played several times to unlock the growth effect of a weapon. Then, in order to pass the game, you have to choose this weapon for each round. As mentioned earlier, because the weapons, elements and treasures are related. Once the weapon is restricted, the random elements and treasures may become worthless. I also fully realize the excitement and refreshment decreases.  The excellent roguelite game should improve the randomness and the richness of the props. As long as the player has good skills or a good luck, it can be easily cleared. The failed roguelite game is to increase the game time by increasing the difficulty and game time. What the player needs is a refreshing roguelite experience instead of a Dark Souls-like game.  Summary: The art style is unique, all roguelite elements are complete, good operating feels, but the slow unlocking of weapons and treasures, single way to get, the effect which force to bind each other, etc., the actual play is difficult to understand the rich randomness and diversity of the game.

Very pretty game. The art work reminds me of the Chinese paintings. The AI seems very smart. It is one of those games where you think I will go in for a few min. and 2 hr. later you are still trying to talk yourself in to quitting. There is always something that needs to be done. Not a bad price for the time you get out of it.
"A curious addition to the Monty Mole series, Moley Christmas was (originally) released as a free promotional demo to be bundled with Your Sinclair magazine in (I believe) 1987. It was never meant to be sold as a standalone product and anyone hoping to get a full experience out of it will be sorely disappointed - it can be played through in literally 2 minutes and almost certainly not worth the €3 asking price on its own. The net experience will probably last about 10-15 minutes as you try to fathom your way through each screen by way of trial and error.  Gamers who play this without understanding the context may struggle to understand what the heck is going on. Screen 3 in particular requires a crucial tid-bit of information from the original magazine (designed to be cut out as a cassette inlay): specifically, you need EIGHT tapes to proceed.  Plus points? Well, it's an interesting insight into (or throwback to, depending on your age) the UK gaming journalism industry of the 1980s (and may make you slightly nostalgic for the unique brand of humour exhibited by Your Sinclair). It features the magnificent Auf Wiedersehen Monty theme by the late and legendary Ben Daglish, although that vastly superior game also available here on Steam for a couple of euros more (and the Spectrum AY version pales in comparison to the C64 version anyway)."
"The game made me feel guilty, sad and depressed over killing harmless little crab :("
It's good for your health ( ͡° ͜ʖ ͡°)
While the game rocks in pretty much every aspect I've came across some kind of issue. When in the place with mom and the counselour the mom fights begins game couldn't load images and I was stuck in endless loop of waiting for this to be fixed but the game cannot load the file.
"I find myself a little confused. I picked this up on sale for the release promo and i think 2 of the 7 achievements are bugged. Other than that, it was a very strait forward castle defense type game that is probably more of an early access. Not a whole lot of content. It has good potential though. It could also do with maybe 1 more audio track.  Over all, Looking forward to updates. thumbs up for keeping my attention while waiting for the other shoe to drop!"
I LOVE THE NEW DOBA ONLY IF THEYD MAKE A NEWYORKER OR A NEWPORT OR AN IMPERIAL 64-77 IMP 63-80 NEWYORKER AND 64-80 NEWPORT
"Worst shooter I have played. The game says ""bug fix"" or ""game update"" and doesn't tell us anything else. It's crazy how incompetent they are."
"I like the overall atmosphere and flow, been looking forward to the 2021 edition of the game especially for this route. The included rolling stock could be a little better, but it's acceptable. I'm mostly driving my own locos of choice on it anyway, which are mostly steamers. Now, I want to like this route and I do like it. It's quite original, being a rather lenghty non-electrified rural line with many stations and some nice landmarks. I really like the parts going through dense forests with trees towering over the tracks on both sides. BUT The biggest flaw of this route to me is that it's way too dark with classic sky mode. In the middle of the day in sunny weather in summer, it looks like it's about to rain heavily. It looks good and sunny when I enable the dynamic sky, but it impacts performance, and I generally have mixed feelings towards the dynamic sky, as it makes a really nice effect of shadows being cast from clouds on the ground and generally gives the game kinda sweeter lighting, but it also makes the sky completely clear because clouds only render right above the player. Also I don't like the absolute lack of any non-player consists in quickdrive, not even static. It's not a big thing because it's mostly a single line, so AI would not really show itself a lot, but the bigger stations feel very empty because of that. The entire route lacks colour and life in many places. I can't help but imagine a version of it made by creators of Berlin-Leipzig or Konstanz-VIllingen and regret that it isn't like this. Or even just made more like Stralsund-Sassnitz, which seems to be made by DTG but feels much more colourful and alive. I don't think this route is worth its full price, but if you find it on a nice discount, then sure I do recommend! I hope DTG decides to do more routes like this. I think the UBB railway could be a good idea, for example. Especially with its unique non-red liveries and the fact that it pokes its way through the Polish border in a funny fashion.  I think I'll be keeping an eye on Rail-Sim.de in case somebody creates an upgrade of this one."
"i went into this with the idea that it would be like the classic flash game ""rail of war"". the concept is great but this game is just awful! it looks like a game that a preschooler learning game design and coding could make, do not waste your money on this if you do, get a refund!  i just want to see ""rail of war"" ported to steam or at least able to play it again  :c"
This is not worth 21$ on sale nor is it worth 43$ normally. This at most should be 5$ and why tf is it called Fetus?
"I had fun with The Summoning so I had to give this one a shot too. It wasn't as creepy, it was MORE creepy!  Empty house, lights off, grabbed all the items required and followed the instructions to a T. Almost peed myself when someone knocked on my door 10/10 would piss pants again"
"The beautifully modelled class 31 nicely complements the Tees Valley line and gives the timetable some much need variety in stock.   While not having experienced one, the 31 rumbles very much like an old locomotive and the sound effects generally are well done. The braking and accelerating convince too and I particularly enjoyed mastering the 31's characteristics, especially in the cement runs but also running a passenger service with a 101 in tow.   The 3  provided scenarios do try to inject life into the route, however having the same 3-car class 101 pass by every 5 minutes sadly does not convince at all. In timetable mode it fairs better having a decent (above average for TSW) mix of passing traffic although the empty yards still look sad and lifeless - with not a single shunter to be seen.  What does work is that the Tees Valley line has a couple of speed limit changes and quirks that in combination with the 31's handling will reward your driving skill and building route knowledge. That's particularly something I enjoyed here and the combo 31+Tees generally worked for me. It's just unfortunate that only 1 scenario really made use of the possibilities.   Recommendation?  In the end, the best thing about the 31 to me is that it has lots of character in handling, sounds and looks - unlike for example the super polished class 47 on the watch-the-grass-grow West Somerset route, or an ICE3.  So, I really like the 31, it's one of my favourite TSW2 drives. If you love those 'fly-by-wire' trains, this one may not be for you. Otherwise, if the price works for you and you're fine with the poor scenario situation - go for it."
"This game should be called ""My Name Is Cobbled Asset Waste Casserole (C.A.W.K.)""  It is nothing but a perfect example of what I call a A.R.S.M.  (Asset Reliant Sloppy Mess) because it's not an asset flip.  It's just a mess of purchased Assets with no cohesion, no functionality what-so-ever, and bugs galore.  This is seen well in my first impressions video where this game made my list of truly amazing Steam games I call M.I.S.S. games:  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYmHpSqOvYk  My score is a 3% out of 100, only because the developer made a decent intro trailer.  Everything else sucks.  Usually I try and give constructive feedback on this indie games, but there's really nothing here to praise.. How hard is it to buy a bunch of assets on the marketplace and mash them together into a big mess and extract it to sell on Steam?  $20 is ridiculous as this game isn't even worth 49 cents in its current state."
Very  nice and original  art style of CG girls - most valuable part of this game (IMHO). We needs moar of it.
"A great game to pick up and play with friends. The controls are smooth and enjoyable, and it works really well over Steam Remote Play!  I've watched this game grow over the last few years and am really happy it's finally out!"
very interesting game
this is the best game on steam. best £3.39 i have ever spent.
I actually had fun with this game. It's rough around the edges but is pretty simple once you get going. Glad I was able to find this.
Just give us the soundtrack for free for screwing up the remake.
"Night of The Scarecrows is a quirky survival FPS in which the goal is to survive as long as possible while spooky scarecrows spawn continuously from various spots on the map.  All scarecrows kill with one hit, some are faster than others, and there are three special types: spitters are slow but project poison onto you which dramatically slows you and disturbs movement for a short duration; flamers deal some explosive damage and cannot be killed with the shovel; stompers move at a snail's pace but take a tremendous amount of damage.  The player can sprint for a limited time, but moves slowly once stamina has depleted and until it replenishes, so this is best reserved for quick getaways.  Your speed also declines when your health is low.  As of now there are three modes.  ""Quick Death"" involves killing groups of enemies with one shot, rewarding you with ammo for every two kills.  The flare gun's splash damage hurts the player and is lethal within melee range.  The shovel is used for close combat or to conserve ammo and must be aimed very precisely.  Scarecrows toting a crate on their back drop a bazooka, which has a much greater splash radius.  Gas jugs can be filled by two pumps when activated to power a harvesting machine which mutilates scarecrows for a period of time.  ""Barn massacre"" mode plays much like Quick Death though on a smaller map and weapons which spawn periodically, and only one pump.  Additional weapons include the machine gun and shotgun.  ""Tower Defence"" is focused on defending a Mother Mary statue which provides precious ammo in exchange for prayer and equips you with a sniper rifle.  Some scarecrows will pursue you while others assault the statue.  GOOD:  The nostalgic atmosphere is reminiscent of classic horror films and doesn't overstay its welcome.  The scarecrows are a little corny in a good way and sometimes even creepy and the challenge is exhilarating.  BAD:  Mobility can be clunky.  Taking too much splash damage slows you down until you find some health, and running scarecrows are impossible to escape while in this state.  This wouldn't be an issue if flare splash damage were slightly reduced and I do feel that it is too high for such cramped environments, especially given how limited stamina is.  This leads to more frustration than necessary and I think it will push a lot of potential players away.  Nine times out of ten I lose to mobility issues due to a combination of damage taken and low stamina.  All in all this is a fun, unique game that offers a real challenge and both quick, casual gameplay or grinding match after match, and I eagerly look forward to more developments and improvements from the developer.  In the meantime, I'll see you out on the farm."
"[h1]While it's obvious the developer spent a lot of time on the art, [i]Just Take Your Left[/i] is sparse enough on other details to make me wish I'd gone right.[/h1]  I adore point-and-click games, and I adore detective stories, so putting those two together is a surefire way to pique my interest. Although [i]Just Take Your Left[/i] sounded like it checked both of those boxes, in reality the game experience was too short and random rather than the advertised fun and humorous. I completed the full game in under 45 minutes, and I honestly think it could have been less time if I hadn’t been looking for more.  [h1]Art Style and Graphics[/h1] The art style is where [i]Just Take Your Left[/i] really shines, with over 3,000 hand-drawn animations according to its store page. However, as will be detailed in the following sections, the problem at the end of the day is this is meant to be a game rather than a movie.  [h1]Game Universe[/h1] More details of the story’s premise and the main character are given on the store page than is given in the game. Unfortunately, I also believe English may not be the developer’s first language, and it doesn’t seem he invested in a translator. From the store page, I know that the plot is meant to be funny, but for me it was mostly confusing and felt very random. Who is the rat character? What are his motives in preventing the detective from getting the diamond? Unlike in many point-and-click games, there is no dialogue or comments from the main character to help you in solving the puzzles. When there is dialogue that maybe is meant to be a clue, it is so poorly phrased that it’s uncertain it is a clue, so it definitely isn’t particularly useful.  https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2314594100  [h1]Gameplay and Mechanics[/h1] The gameplay experience mostly amounted to randomly clicking things due to the aforementioned lack of clues. As an example, there is a door knob that the player is meant to click on three times to get it off, but the character doesn’t say, “This knob seems loose,” or “Maybe I just need to pull harder,” or anything that could potentially clue the player in that it needs to be interacted with further. The lack of clues to aid in solving puzzles led me to expect that the game might take longer to complete, so I was very surprised when I completed the full game in under 45 minutes. Some of this may have been due to puzzles that were really more like quick time events, where the character just keeps dying until the right object is clicked fast enough.  One of the reasons that the gameplay experience being so short is very off-putting is that there were indications that there was more to explore and do. For example, there’s a door that is labeled “Seven Door” that never leads to anywhere or serves any role in the game. Why was it included at all? This isn’t to say that point-and-click puzzle solutions always make logical sense, but generally what makes them work is the in-game dialogue from the character. Lacking that made it all seem very random without anything to make it humorous.  https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2314594886  [h1]Audio[/h1] There are a couple of notable music tracks. There is a particularly chipper song that seems like it belongs in a jaunty retailer commercial, and the song that plays when ghosts are encountered is nicely on-brand. Sound effects are minimal, but what is there makes sense. There is no voice narration.  [h1]Verdict[/h1] Despite being cheap ($3.99 at the time of review), I still would say to give [i]Just Take Your Left[/i] a pass for those looking for a point-and-click adventure game. While it had no technical performance issues, the game lacks the mental engagement level I’ve come to expect from point-and-click genre puzzles, and there are no achievements, trading cards, or other bonus materials to extend the experience.

Pros : story is interesting to see the gameplay is kind of unique   Cons: Collisions glitches can harm the gameplay real bad Partial controller support is wonky at best
"meh its playable and readable but didnt really move me enough to want to finish reading it.  The characters you interact with are pretty boring, about the only thing that seemed well thought out was the actual seige / combat.  Which is probably why I wasnt interested in finishing the story, as I read these more for the characters and their stories.  Its a good game, as far as these CYOAs go, but its pretty far down the list of good stories to read imho.  As always YMMV."
"This game is very sinister, the white witch's laugh makes you want to run, lol, I really liked it, very engaging sound effects"
"Pythagorean Complex doesn't seem to have much to do with Pythagoras, so if you're hoping some ancient mathematician action here, you'll be disappointed.  Likewise, if you're looking for a decent game here, you'll be disappointed, because this is a minimalist/retro top down action puzzle game that doesn't even have 3D graphics, let alone proper resolution settings (although you can change the zoom level).   Different from a lot of shovelware, however, while the technical implementation is lacking sorely due to phoned in graphics and without even the basics in terms of customising visuals and controls, at least some game design went in here.  There's quite a few levels and it's obvious some planning went into those.  Unfortunately games need to come at least close to being the sum of their parts, and with such a sloppy technical implementation, no matter how well one aspect of the game was done, it's overall negatives here.  It's just not fun to play with such bad/lazy graphics.   The game is completely free.  Nothing speaks more to a developers belief in themselves and their product than making their game available for everyone without remuneration.  This is certainly a gesture that shows dedication to the gaming industry.  It's a shame in this case that the implementation is below the minimum standards a dedicated PC game should offer to enthusiasts.   There's no ""maybe"" option in Steam, unfortunately, but I hope to see more work from this developer, perhaps as part of a professional game development company that can make full use of their talents without needing to make budget/quality compromises.

"This game is surprisingly addictive. Stripping a genre down to bare bones to see what new things might appear has, of course, been done many times before, but this game demonstrates precisely why that's the case. There are far more resources than the average grand strategy game, perhaps more comparable to an Anno or Settlers title, but stripped-down gameplay makes it easy to understand how to obtain what you need to achieve your objective.  As one might expect, the interface is tastefully minimalist and generally easy to understand. The music is very enjoyable, to the point that I'm reluctant to mute it and watch videos on my second monitor as I often do with other games (even though this game is otherwise perfect, gameplay-wise, for doing exactly that).  [h1]Improvement Suggestions:[/h1]  There are some persistent issues with the UI/UX, but not enough to make me stop playing. Most are just issues of polishing, but I think a few larger UI tweaks would also be helpful:  - Text size seems small, or it doesn't scale well.  - The black numbers in mouseover resource tooltips can't be seen on black backgrounds, and tooltips will often overlap each other, making all or part of one or both of them unreadable. This could probably be fixed by putting the tooltips in foreground boxes.  - It's difficult to see some of the connections paths between cities. These should be more prominent in general, and perhaps highlight when mousing over connected cities.  - Needing to navigate through menus to see various map info filters is a pain point, especially when each filter gives only one, very specific piece of information. A row of selectable filters at the bottom of the screen could be a more intuitive and easier-to-use substitute. Also, region information (and maybe even landmarks) should probably just be integrated into the normal map. It is, after all, a map.  - Similarly, city information also needs to be more accessible. Either a mouseover tool tip, or using the left sidebar seems appropriate. Oddly, tracking the population of each culture in units of 10,000 is the opposite of stripping down the genre, and it makes resource generation more difficult to understand. Culture resource generation likewise should be more accessible.  - Bottom line on UI: for the amount of information this game has, I don't feel like I should need to navigate away from the map at all.  Other miscellaneous thoughts:  - It doesn't make sense that you can't Trade with independent cities, when you can use most other interactions with them, as well as Trade with factions that hate you.  - I've played 3 factions so far: Hegemony (Silver), Chirping Tribe (Gold), Eastern Margraves (Gold). Despite the seeming emphasis on Excavate and Relics in the mechanics explanations, I have yet to feel any need to Excavate, especially given the extremely low chances of finding Relics in the first place.  - Most landmarks don't feel worth it to Build, especially when the Build amount is fixed at 1,000 per turn, and doubly especially for most over 20k. I feel like Build should change based on total population and maybe cultures present, but at the same time, making the amount of Labour needed to Build continually go up doesn't seem like a good idea, either. Maybe keep the Build amount fixed, but replace the running tally with ""Progress"" or something similar, and Build can generate a variable amount of Progress based on the factors I mentioned earlier. (Also, it might make sense to have Build cost different amounts in different places. It's much easier to build a gate than it is to mine tin, or unearth a ziggurat, after all!)  - Assuming they don't exist already, it would be nice if there were conditions (even if hidden from the player) to prevent post-start factions from appearing. I feel like I've seen different factions appear in different playthroughs, so there are probably specific triggers already, but it's not clear how specific the triggers are, and for which special factions.  - Would also be nice to eventually be able to play as those special factions!  Overall, though, this is a fantastic game, and a very successful experiment!"
"This game starts out so promising, played with a couple of friends, and by the end of it we all felt an overwhelming sense of disappointment. The game play is alright at best, but the level design progressively gets worse while adding nothing new to the game. Everything up until the swamp was manageable but after it just devolves into a fetching quest for every level. There is a lack off care for game play overcompensated by the beautiful atmosphere and interesting monster visual design, but mechanically they were almost the same. The ending is awful, it ties no loose ends and has nothing to do with the story at all, every detail that made the beginning feel so interesting were ignored or briefly brushed over leading to a large amount of confusion. Not recommended for the story mode, the case files are interesting but it just feels like a phasmo-esque game after that. All in all, on sale maybe but full price never."
Game Fu**ing Sucks you can't move and turn at the same times and the controls are w a s d and arrow keys and you can't edit them.

"Graphics: the style of black and white with colored accents is really well done- for the most part there's a nice clarity to it all (minus some bones that look like they might be able to be walked over) and a lot of restraint is used in what is chosen to be colored. Boss design range from referential to repulsive in the same comedic way like Castle Crasher's Catfish boss, but feel unique from one another and from the normal baddies.  Gameplay: Bomberman but strange duckbomberman creature instead. Rapidly launching bombs feels really nice, hitting things and destroying the environment feels impactful, Dashing through stages especially feels rewarding and frenetic. Some small issues with the cooldown with dashing feeling a bit random, and limitations to launching bombs where after 8-9 the next will suddenly not be launched and lead to a lot of accidental self-explosion during bosses. Stages in Story Mode scale up nicely, though it does treat you to a lot of dead ends and force you to explore around for the exit and the key, so if you like more linear experiences this might frustrate you especially near the end.  Story: pretty much just enough to give you motivation to go kill a bunch of things and destroy other ducks, but I didn't feel like it needed much else.  Overall I'd say it's underrated and I was surprised about the general Mixed status since this is a good experience to play through. No thoughts on Multiplayer as I've not tried it."
"Bottom line up front:  I'm really liking what I see here.    The gameplay of this rougelike is sort of like the lovechild of FTL and Darkest Dungeon.  Decisions made on the map have consequences and there is some interplay between characters.  Graphics are the pixelated type and feel retro in a good way, and the music and sound are *top notch* and help the atmosphere.  Gameplay is tough but not especially frustrating, there's some variety of enemies and strategy is required in most encounters, and learning different skill and party combinations is a satisfying loop with the three maps that are complete (I've yet to get to the end).  Like in FTL, you get the increasing sense of impending doom with a failing run as missteps or bad luck adds up.  While there is no ""equipment"" at this time (not sure if this is planned), ""trinkets"" provide the entire party with benefits that really affect your strategy that fill this niche.  The game is stable, the battles are tight, I haven't observed any real bugs.  Overall, the developer has released a product with a fair bit of polish, and It feels like a late beta--so far better than many Early Access titles.  There's what seems like a skeleton of an unlock/upgrade system in place, and a decent but limited number of in-game events (I've gotten multiples after several playthrough attempts).  I also hope to see a few more fight backdrops.  Overall, glad I got it now."
"Absolutely Awesome, highly addictive & Love this game, This game is a side scrolling shoot em in a world of its own, Original & bizarre. you have four different weapons (XBOX 360) B-Red button fires right weapon, A-Green button Fires weapon down, X-Blue button fires left weapon, Y-Orange button fires up weapon, Each one of the those weapons have different fire power and charge shot, the more i play i will keep adding to my review and my thoughts so far of this Amazing game...Highly Recommended...Buy it and have loads of fun!!"
i would not get the game has mostly negative reviews
"This game is very pleasing, nice puzzles, beautiful and just love for the robot animations, they are so cute! The mechanics are very well designed and clever and the way they are presented just shows the level of detail the developers gave to the product. I highly recommend!! Its fun!! Congrats to the developers."
"I don't like aliens, nor cows. But what I do like is puzzles. And pushing things around. And pretty games with nice soundtracks. This game has all of that in spades and is a great time killer.  The puzzles quickly become challenging. Highly addicting and highly recommended!"

Wrote a glowing review in game. Truly loved it. Paid for the donation happily.   NO SO F&^%$^& HAPPILY pd tax on a donation. Steam or whoever you F*&^%*&^%*& piss me off. Give the 80 cents to TLS or don't charge at all.   Off my soap box and still love TLS. TY for a wonderful game experience.
"A enjoyable top down game where you try to speak to the manager as you mall down soldiers XD   I kinda wish there was a behind the shoulder or 3rd person camera view. Since, the over to top view camera does take away from the challange. So having a 3rd person camera could lead to the player having to pay attention to the gun lights so much more. Making the gameplay to gameplay even more tense. Since, the over the top camera does make things a bit easy.   Non the less. This is still a fun game to play in bursts."
I just buy it  If the money resulting from buying this dlc goes to the cancer sick people i wish them good health
"一款纯走剧情的游戏，中间有几个选项，但不知道对结局有没有影响。 这个游戏讲的是在新冠肺炎爆发前夕，一个20来岁的女孩回家看望父母、妹妹、弟弟、奶奶、外公外婆，结果导致奶奶感染新冠之后家里各种矛盾逐渐爆发的故事。 虽然画面比较烂，但是中前期剧情还是比较吸引人的，里面其实涉及新冠的内容并不太多，相反更关注的是保守专制（甚至有点反科学）的家长与崇尚独立自由的子女之间的家庭关系和个人成长问题。但是遗憾的是游戏时长只有两个小时，结尾非常仓促，感觉应该到高潮的地方，结果什么事情都没解决就突然迎来了制作组名单。 希望作者能有补完剧情的打算。  Despite the poor graphic effects, the story is surprisingly quite engaging. It focuses not on the Covid itself, but rather on the relationship among family members, in particular a daughter seeking independence and personal development and a dictator-like (and even somewhat anti-science) mother, when they are forced to be lived under the same roof. It is actually a very good and unique perspective for telling a story. Unfortunately, the game ends abruptly at its peak, with a lot of things remaining unanswered. I really hope that the author could make supplement or a sequel to this game, so that we could see a more smooth full stop."
"An intriguing and stylish detective game. Really love what Achimo has going on here! Looking forward to playing more, but can pretty safely assume its worth your time to pick up :)"
"SE4 much better, worst of the whole franchise"
"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zKQBQBZRLVc  Neat and thrilling escape-room game where you a a captured prisoner trying to escape. You need to solve puzzles and find clues in order to progress which can take multiple attempts as things are not so easy as you get caught and have to retry. The story is also interesting with twists and turns throughout, as well as suspense from the environment of the area and audio that is played. Gameplay and puzzles is ok but sometimes hard as things are not so obvious and require hints. Exploring is pretty fun though as you go through what's available within your reach and reading through things like diaries and journals to progress."
Laggy and boring

"The prologue of this game is disappointingly short, lasting just around 3 minutes. It doesn't offer much substance to form a comprehensive review. The choices within the game don't seem to have significant impact, as they ultimately lead to the same destination. However, what these choices do provide is a dose of amusing dialogue, presented in a cartoonish manner that swiftly transitions to 'another reality' to complement the roleplaying aspect.  On a positive note, Erin's character model is well-designed and refreshing. It doesn't rely on the exaggerated depiction of a woman's body often seen in other games of this genre. The attention to detail in creating a more realistic and relatable character is commendable."

"Good model and sounds, the bus drives very well in game with no lag.  However, it's a complete pig to repaint. Is it really too difficult to provide a white template for people to use instead of one with multiple layers with different parts of the repaint on it? It's completely unusable if you want to produce a non-BVG repaint. Disappointing."
It's like god spilled a game. But it's kinda fun.  
"Stormblades is a mobile app that's been dumped on Steam as if it was a real PC game (it's not)... it's a cash grab from greedy mobile devs.  The game is an ultra simple QTE game where you swipe your iPhone screen at each prompt to make the 3D rendered sword guy slash or dodge.  Like Dance Dance Revolution but without any decent music or depth... it really is garbage.  The mobile port here is so lazy the developer didn't even bother changing any of the mobile app prompts so you get ""tap"" and ""swipe"" prompts.  Ugh.  Mobile phones have made gaming worse for everyone.  From a technical perspective, the game doesn't meet basic minimum requirements that most PC gamers expect as standard.  The controls can't be customised, which will be an annoyance for many, but it can also render the game unplayable for differently-abled gamers.  Because this is a mobile app, it carries a number of deliberate design deficiencies.  Compromises were made to cater to the iPhones that the game was designed for, in this case, somewhat low poly count game assets (that look ok I guess but not great), low res textures and very shallow gameplay.  These are unfortunate handicaps and limitations that PC gamers shouldn't be forced to accept, but it's evident that PC was an afterthought for the iPhone developers who are to blame for this.  The game is deficient as a result of these choices, and would have been so much better without the handicaps that designing games for mobile phones forces upon a game.  Once more, mobile devs have made gaming worse for everyone.  I didn't spend thousands on building a gaming rig just so I could pretend it's an iPhone.  These technical defects push this game below acceptable standards for any modern PC game.  It's worth noting this mobile app port is so bad it only ever had two concurrent players on Steam... gamers have been avoiding this like cancer.  And so they should.   Once more we see greedy mobile devs trying to scam PC gamers. On Steam, this is $4 USD, on app stores, it's free. Mobile devs must learn PC gamers are not here to be gouged, and can't be expected to pay a premium for a free mobile game just because it's been lazily dumped on Steam.  This is unacceptable disrespect for PC gamers.  Because this can be played free elsewhere, and because of the other defects, it's impossible to recommend.  Who do they think we are?"
"非常喜欢这个游戏，画面和音乐都十分吸引我，玩法也很感兴趣，但是没有中文。希望能出中文版。 I really like the game. The music and graphics are just just what I want , and so as the gameplay. The only disappointment is lack of Chinese localization, which I am hoping some day we can have. Thanks"
"I'm not usually one for meditation or virtual reality, but the way the lessons are skillfully crafted in ZenVR, with research backing, has really helped me become more interested in the meditation field. I now go to places in the real world to meditate using the lessons I learned in ZenVR. ZenVR is a great foundation for beginners and I look forward to the developers continued updates."
"I'm on the neutral side, The game is fun and entertaining but there's not really much to do and the weapons don't do much damage and your character cannot move and you cannot change graphic settings or volume settings i understand this game is still early access but i suggest making the pistol do more damage for example. Make the rate of weapon spawning higher and add automatic weapons finally please add the option to change graphic/volume settings and maybe add the option to raid Area 51 yourself."
games player base is dead.. and i cant even get into a server without it crashing either T-T your better off spending your money on path of titans or the isle. at least you'll be able to find servers with 100+ people on them! unlike this game.... 
I really like what I've seen of the game so far. It reminds me a lot of dead cells but I am liking this more so far. I threw it on my Deck for kicks and giggles and an very pleased with the performance!
recommended
"Amazing roleplay experience to enjoy with friends. The game is in the first steps of development but is playable and enjoyfull even though. The detailed assets, characters and environment makes EO's a gem that should probably turn into a masterpiece in a nearly future! I cannot wait to see the possibilities of gameplay."
Not a 100% sure if all the Marvel Pinball cabinets are this good but hopefully they are.
[url=https://store.steampowered.com/curator/35705466-Indie-Low-End-Laptop-games/] Follow my Steam Curator page for more reviews [/url]  I'm pretty sure the main character was inspired by Starfire from Teen Titans :) Moon Raider offers everything a platformer should have: - tons of collectables (gems and releasing imprisoned aliens) - hidden areas  - traps - challenging boss fights The game even has local co-op but I haven't had the chance to try it since I don't own a controller. The keyboard controls are adequate but I wish there was an option to remap them.
"Gunhildr isn't going to win any awards, but what it does win is my respect for atleast trying to big something much larger than what its budget clearly allowed for. The foundation is here, decent story with lore galore, decent weapons with decent movement and enemy variety, and decent ideas like the overheat mechanic. Nothing here however is above average, its all decent which would be fine for a $10 or even $15 game, but the $20 price tag puts it into whole new bracket, filled with titles like Gunfire reborn, Noita, even Spleunky 2 is only a single Andrew Jackson.   Im not saying the game is bad, but you need to do better if you're going to price it so high with so many A+ titles. At max currently, a $10 game to play when you're bored. Assuming they make a sequel, try to make a more interesting draw to suck people in. You could have told me this game was made in 2015 and i'd 100% believe it, it screams Unity just from the screen shots alone. I respect the effort, and look forward to a potential sequel."
"Well, here comes the prologue of the Entity Researchers game, which I was waiting for to plunge into the old-school gaming of the 90s. In this game, you will need to kill bacteria in the dungeons and collect loot, and you will also need to scan the bacteria to fight them. The game has real-time turn-based combat, so you will need to press the buttons to attack, defend or restore health. In general, the idea of ​​​​the game is good, I personally liked to play it."

"[b]Introduction[/b] Galacticon is a retro arcade inspired game, a mix between Defender and Joust with puzzle mechanics. Capture humans and then fly them back to your ship, reach the boss, defeat him and start over.  [b]Gameplay[/b] You have a regular fire button and a button to toggle auto-fire on/off. There are power ups to pick up in the form of shields, weapon upgrades, bombs and lives. Gems will just give points. The humans you pick up are placed in the four corners of your ship and are vulnerable. You can deposit them in cages. The more you drop off at once the more points they reward. You get bonus points according to the colours of the humans you put together. You have limited time to collect all humans to fill the cages.  Once all the cages are filled you have to transport them back to your ship. This section is different per level, but basically you need to collect as much gems as you can and not get hit. every 8 levels you face a boss and the game loops to the beginning at a higher difficulty.  [b]Leaderboard[/b] There's only a local leaderboard for Steam but you get a QR code that lets you upload your score to a global cross platform leaderboard. I find it a bit cumbersome to do each time but you need to do it to participate in a contest and it unlocks tips and extras. There are Win10 apps that will read the QR code from your clipboard so you don't have to reach for your mobile all the time. To capture the QR code in your clipboard you can use (the shortcut for) Snip and Sketch.  I do really hope a Steam leaderboard will be added because the game is great for score chasing and competing with others but doing so anonymously is not as much fun.

"One of the best casual and stress-free puzzle with endless playability. You can't lose and there are constant rewards.  The sole objective of this game is to clear all of the lines off the board by moving from shortest to longest. This is all done with a mouse; left-click to choose a line, and double-click to confirm selection.  This game contains no preset stages. Every time you press the play button, you get a random puzzle and a random pattern selected from the pool of unlocked patterns. If you don't like it, press the shuffle and instantly receive a new puzzle.   The gameplay is quick because a single puzzle can be solved in a matter of seconds. The only hint of difficulty comes from the patterns themselves, since it can be tough to distinguish individual lines at times.   You can't fail a puzzle because you can misclick as many times as you like. However, if you make sure to click on the correct lines and do so quickly, you will earn points that will allow you to unlock new patterns. You can let the game decide which pattern unlocks next, or you can select your preferred one. The added feature is that you can use a pattern as a wallpaper for your desktop.  Patterns are simply different ways of displaying lines. Many patterns have that 60s-70s abstract look to them. While the majority must be unlocked first, this game contains over 250 patterns. The number of distinct patterns is actually lower because they are divided into separate packs that comply with a certain style. Each pack contains eight patterns with varying line widths and spacing between them."
"Wow, what a game!  What an intense adrenaline rush! Super fast pacing driven by an ever ongoing great soundtrack which wouldn't let you stop. You just need to play that one more round.   Really easy to get into, but you can easily spend hours perfecting your team, your skills or your strategies. Stadium Builder looked like a lot of fun, too! So many options! I focused on the gameplay for now and wanted to get better. The later stages were really challenging, but when you're finally able to score, it's extra rewarding.   It's amazing to see so much content and polish while having extraordinary gameplay and mechanics in an early access game.  I love it and my hands hurt!"
"I got POWER! I liked the theme of this one better than the first. It felt very similar, but I've always liked gladiators more than other forms of fantasy because it feels a bit more realistic to me."
I bought this dlc and it didn't appear in game.  Read all the community post. Nothing can help me atm. In a few day I'm going to get a refund. what a shame. The game is well made but very buggy. I'm running a amd motherboard and amd rx570 gpu. Never had any problem with other game until now.
"This is a highly enjoyable playable version of the classic gamebook. The choice of narrator is excellent, especially when he voices a specific character.  The only real negatives are some of the combat messages dont always make sense relative to the monster, or to your character at that point.  More of these, especially for some of the rarer books would be excellent."
"Can't really think of much to say. There's some rough edges here and there, but overall, I enjoyed this game a fair amount as a fan of bullet hell/danmaku Metroidvanias and would recommend it to anyone looking for a similar experience to Rabi-Ribi."
It's still in development with not much to do but I guess it's okay
The plane is Very Nice but When i  rotate the plane even at 200 Knots i pull The yoke up The alleron go's up But the plane stays on the runway please fix this i tried to fly my favorite boeing plane bet it was very unfortunite and people that Think of buying this i do not recomend it unless you want to waste money
"At times movement reminded me of Dandara, ricocheting bullets like Steamworld Heist and visuals similar to No Way Home - making it a well packaged and enjoyable game."
"Sniper Elite 5 - First Impression Review  I'm writing this as a Sniper Elite 4 vet, and you should read this if you have already played SE4. If you haven't, feel free to read it also.  The question is, ""Should I spend my time on Sniper Elite 5?"". The answer is Yes, if you're familiar with the Sniper Elite franchise.  Graphically wise, it's improved from the last game(which is Sniper Elite 4, by the way). The color is much more defined, although it didn't overshadow the last game. Texture wise, things such as rocks and foliages and buildings, are not much different from SE4, unless you're counting pixels. Water looks better, although not significantly. Ballistic looks more enjoyable. Kill cam is more intimate and more casual. Body movements have been improved: Karl now ascending/ descending stairs with careful steps rather than running/ stampeding through as seen in SE4. Sniper Rifle's Scopes has more natural sway to it. Soldiers can be spotted wearing watches, added more realism to it. Conclusion, it's improved, the same way GOW Ragnarok compared to GOW.   Gameplay is more or less the same. I would say that this game adopted several key mechanisms from The Last of Us. Infinite stones for distraction are now replaced with limited bottles. Infinite Satchel Charges from SE4 are now replaced with Satchel Charges picked up from battlefields(you can still carry an inhuman amount of them, however). SE5 now introduced work benches(again, The Last of Us), with significantly more weapon adjustments compared to SE3(rudimentary) or SE4(non-existent).  You might have seen some reviews online saying that SE5 is not as big as SE4, which is debatable. I would say that the maps are more compact but still big. It still can stump an SE4 vet like me from time to time.  Picking up weapons from battlefields is no longer something you can do freely as in SE4, but I like it as it's significantly realistic. You can't just pick up a Sniper Rifle from the field and fire it, it doesn't work like that. However, you're allowed to use it as Temporary, which is acceptable. There are many more varieties to pick up from the field as well: weapons with attachments that give you advantages.  Weapon Wheel is the same. God vision, or something called Enemy Position has also been replaced with zones of interest(a colored circle that signifies the whereabouts of an enemy). Why, hello there, Ghost Recon Wildlands, I have missed you. This makes it more important to tag enemies, as you're no longer given the Detective Vision back in SE4. Iron Sight is now officially in the game. Love it. You can now take out enemies with non-lethal melee technique as well. Guess that they're slowing down after all the gruesome close-combat takedowns back in SE4.  There are also fewer enemies in SE5, compared to SE4. In SE4, thanks to God vision, you can take out an entire base of enemies, like 20 or 30 of them Nazis, but here in SE5, even 3 to 4 of them is already some struggle. I personally think it's more intimate.  Music is not a thing. The warrior of Rome motif in SE4 is no longer here. I don't miss it particularly, but this is also a different game anyway. I would say that the Alarm sounds remind me of Wolfenstein a lot. It's okay, i don't think people are too hung up on the music department for this game.  The game ran well on my dated machine! It heated up the machine even less than SE4, what a relief!. Kudos to you, Rebellion.  As of now, the complete edition is quite expensive, but i'm happy with my Deluxe Edition. Will be purchasing the full Edition in the future.  The game is good, i will greenlit it if you ask me. That's all I have to say for now."

"[b]Moon Raider[/b] is yet another 2D action platformer where you are tasked with collecting X - in this case, moon crystals to cure your ill mother. In the vast ocean of indie games that are currently available on Steam, this game is just another generic title that simply does not hold up to the standard that other developers have set. Between the simplistic levels, tedious boss fights, and handful of bugs, the lack of innovation and polish is clear almost immediately.

Clearly the developers put a lot of effort into the visual aspect; however, perhaps a similar amount of effort should have been put into the story and gameplay as well.  [/list]  [h1]➖[u]Neutral:[/u][/h1] [list] [*]The main character [b]seems to be inspired by MegaMan but only shares a superficial resemblance[/b]. Besides the pose and the blaster (that doesn’t charge), there are no other MegaMan-like elements both in terms of gameplay and design.  [*]There are [b]multiple hidden collectables[/b] in the form of salvageable aliens, bonus rooms, and passive upgrades in invisible walls. However, these are, for the most part, incredibly easy to find which takes away from the thrill of finding them. [*]There are [b]numerous small improvements that would immediately improve the polish of this game[/b]: [olist] [*]It would make sense to add a “Continue” option in the main menu. Currently, the default selection when the game starts is “New Game”, even if you already have a save slot. Luckily I didn’t accidentally overwrite my game file but this could easily happen. [*]As far as I could tell, there is no save indicator. I presume the game autosaves, so it would be nice to have an indicator and maybe an announcement at the beginning of the game along the lines of: “This game uses an autosave feature”. [*]Tiny creatures found in different points of the game are either hostile or non-hostile but there is no clear distinction between the two until you take damage. Maybe this can be made clearer? [/olist] [*]The following [b]bugs should also be addressed[/b]:  [olist] [*]Unlike everything else, the “Options” menu in the main menu does not respond to controller inputs, only mouse. [*]There are grooves in the walls that clearly aren’t intended for platforming but still allow the character model to land on it, sometimes resulting in a clunky platforming experience. [*]Unlocking gates/lasers is inconsistent in the sense that sometimes it stops your character from moving and sometimes it doesn’t. My problem with this is that I have died to enemies/insta-kill mechanisms because of the sudden restriction of movement.  [*]Blaster shots can be blocked by dead enemies, even after their corpses disappear. [/olist] [/list]  [h1]❌[u]Negative:[/u][/h1] [list] [*][b]The overall experience is resoundingly mediocre.[/b] Everything works well enough but almost nothing stands out. Levels are very simplistic and require little to no thought to get through. You unlock only one active skill, the dash, early on in the game, which is overpowered and not sufficient to keep the gameplay interesting. Difficulty is often increased by adding insta-kill mechanisms instead of smarter/more complex enemies. Bosses have simplistic attack patterns and are mostly dull. Music is forgettable. [*]The [b]story is shallow and barely ties in with the gameplay[/b]. The game starts with a short cutscene that gives you some context to the game but doesn’t explain much. For example, why did the Selenites turn against their queen? Unfortunately the game does not build on the story or provide any additional background details as you play through. There are only a handful of times where you will receive a call from your father - to provide some tutorial information or to congratulate you for finding a passive upgrade. How about some information about how mom is doing? Maybe some words of encouragement when you hit certain milestones (i.e. 50 moon crystals)? Even the ending cutscene doesn’t show your mom’s recovery, so why did I go through the effort of collecting moon crystals for her? It is easy to lose motivation given that the main goal (saving your mom) almost immediately becomes an afterthought.  [*]There is [b]no replay value[/b] and your [b]save file becomes worthless once you beat the game[/b] - loading it will only trigger the end cutscene and credits. I feel like I wasted time trying to collect all the moon crystals since it has no influence on the ending and there is no option to go back to collect them all. In fact, the final boss drops an all-powerful moon crystal that fills the moon crystal counter to the max (200). So there really is no incentive to collect them during the game. [/list]   [h1]🏅[u]Verdict:[/u][/h1] [h1]★★☆☆☆ Generically dull[/h1] Unfortunately, nothing really sets Moon Raider apart. The lack of innovation in conjunction with the overly simplistic gameplay and poorly incorporated story resulted in a lackluster and tedious experience. Given that there are better games out there at this price point (e.g. Undertale, Minit, Hollow Knight), I cannot recommend Moon Raider.

"the fkin launcher is asssss. EA pisses me off really. I cant play offline, got to update this shitty EA app. then i had to spam click launcher to start the game now it just doesn't even start, at all. this is bullsht. game is nice if it works but fk this EA, go bankrupt already. cancer of gaming industry."
"Great horror/stealth game that features a great soundtrack and good map design. Overall very immersive and fun game, recommended."
"This could be amazing, the concept is really cool, but the rope physics are really jank and ruin the game for me, the rope on certain swing 90% of the time freaks out and becomes super long and ruins your swing, if the dev makes the rope physics better and makes the game look better I would probably recommend it, plus the oculus app for some reason starts when ever I start the game"
"A truly fantastic game. The wonderful design, a story that can make you think of various ideas.  Really nice, nice job Small Throne Team!  I saw from the achievements that there are 3 endings, I will play it again to discover them."
"A simple, relaxing game. It's possible to finish all 50 stages without much challenge, but if you choose to keep under the maximum move limits, the game becomes more difficult. That being said, the move limit is not enforced in an way."
GOOD GAME! but my fps is low
