    "# Task 1\n",
    "In Moodle you will find the file 110723EUParl.docx. Read the text inside into your console.\n",
    "It contains a plenary protocol of the European Parliament from the 11th of July 2023. In this exercise, you will use regular expressions to extract meta information from the file and separate the text into smaller parts. Write functions that can be generalized to other protocols of a similar structure. That is: when you are for instance trying to remove the table of contents, do not just remove the first 7 pages, but find a way to automatically detect when the main part starts (for instance using Regex).\n",
    "When you want to find a certain set of tokens using Regex you might want to proceed as follows:\n",
    "1. Look at the original document and identify structural features that could be used to identify the tokens you are looking for.\n",
    "2. Translate these loose strucutral features into Regex.\n",
    "3. Use Regex to see whether you detect your desired tokens and only your desired tokens.\n",
    "4. Modify your Regex to solve the exercise.\n"
