    "To do this, please visit Huggingface, a website on which open source transformer models are available for the public to download. Look for appropriate models that are able to solve the given task without additional training and compare their performances. Some models on Hug- gingface also provide the option for an inference API directly on the website, enabling you to test out even large language models that usually would not run on local hardware.\n",
